          Crowder and the Celtics gave up 124 points on Monday, which is uncharacteristic of this team. However, the 25-year-old jack of all trades had his best offensive output of his career, and this was the fourth time in 2015-16 that he sank four triples.

The pesky, defensive-minded guard is built to battle on both ends, and he is certainly one of the top hustlers in the league at any position. This was his sixth effort with four or more steals, and he is establishing himself as one of the best ballhawks in basketball.

          Smart's inspired tip drill with Evan Turner led to an easy dunk for Avery Bradley in the fourth quarter that broke the game open for Boston. Smart embodies the grit and hustle that has Boston in third place in the East. That usually doesn't translate into gaudy fantasy stats, but Boston is finding success with an even four guard rotation of Isaiah Thomas, Bradley, Smart and Turner. Expect Smart to continue to receive roughly 27 minutes per game.

          Turner turned the ball over four times, but otherwise it was an efficient game for the former Buckeye. He has hit a three-pointer in back-to-back contests, which is extremely rare for the forward.

          Bradley has scored 20 or more points 13 times this season. In 2014-15, he had 12 such showings, and in 2013-14 he had 17. He has five 20-point performances dating back to Jan. 22, and contributes a couple rebounds, assists, and steals per night as well. If Bradley has five 20-point showings over the next 25 games, he'll eclipse his previous campaign record. However, the 25-year-old is having his best season regardless, and most of his contributions don't show up on a stat sheet. He provides stellar defense and offensive versatility for a surging Celtics team that seems hungry for home-court advantage in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.

          Sullinger had seen 29 and 30 minutes in the previous two contests, but perhaps he might have played more if the game had been a bit closer. Over the last five games, Sullinger has averaged 14.2 points on 54 percent from the field to go with 10 rebounds, four assists, 1.2 steals, 0.4 threes, and 0.2 blocks in 25 minutes per matchup. The departure of David Lee and injury to Kelly Olynyk (shoulder) will make it tough for coach Brad Stevens to overlook Sullinger in terms of court time.

          Thomas led the Celtics to a win on Sunday after dropping Friday's matchup versus the Jazz, and the Celtics are 33-24. Thomas is the team's heart and soul, and he has jumpstarted the rebuild in Boston.  He is exceeding all expectations this season, and the team is soaring in the standings.

          While the rest of his teammates largely struggled against a stalwart Jazz defense, Thomas endured a tough night from the field to still provide his typical level of production. His scoring total was considerably supplemented by his 10 viisits to the charity stripe, making it his third game with double-digit free-thrw attempts already this month. Thomas has also posted over 20 points in five of the last eight contests, and is averaging 22.4 points, 6.7 assists, 3.4 rebounds and 1.3 steals so far in February.

          Crowder was the only other Boston starter who was able to do much to help Isaiah Thomas on the scoreboard, posting his third straight game with double-digit scoring while also shooting over 50 percent for the third time in seven February contests. However, the whistle haunted the four-year pro throughout the night, and he fouled out for the second straight game. Despite the disappointing outcome, Crowder continues to serve as a steady source of multi-category production in all fantasy formats.

He posted double-digit boards for the third straight game, and encouragingly received a higher-than-normal allotment of minutes for the second straight contest.

          Lee parts ways with the Celtics after playing in only 30 games this season. The move isn't too shocking, as it was rumored that the Celtics were looking to move the 32-year-old before the trade deadline.

He averaged 7.1 points, 4.3 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 0.4 blocks, and 0.4 steals in 16 minutes a contest during his 30 games with the Celtics. Although he hasn't played in a game since Jan. 10, the veteran forward could find his way to a team looking to add some frontcourt depth for the run towards the playoffs.

          The 32-year-old Lee was made available by the Celtics prior to the deadline, but, partially due to his $15.5 million expiring contract, he failed to draw interest and will now move toward a potential buyout. The veteran has been a DNP-CD in each of the last 18 games, and he's struggled when in the rotation, while the Celtics have flourished in his absence. Despite a track record of strong production in the past, the market for Lee is not exactly booming, though in a buyout scenario a playoff-contending team looking to add veteran depth may be willing to take a flyer, considering the low risk.

          Turner has been logging a great deal of minutes for the Celtics lately, and deservedly so. The 12 rebounds on Friday were a season-high for Turner and he was also one point shy of matching his best total on the year. Jae Crowder is a little banged up right now, and should he miss an extended amount of time, Turner would become a must-start in nearly every fantasy format. As of now, there is no question that Turner should be on your season-long roster.

It may be a little premature to add him to your season-long roster right now, but keep an eye on him in the next couple of games to get a true indicator of where his role lies with the Celtics.

          Johnson had a great night on the glass with the 13 rebounds, but more impressively, seven of them were on the offensive end. Johnson has had a great season thus far and is currently holding off Jared Sullinger and Kelly Olynyk for the majority of minutes in Boston's rotation. Johnson is a safe play on most nights, and a productive cheap option for DFS purposes if he has a favorable matchup.

          Smart couldn't get a shot to fall from the field on Wednesday, but he was able to contribute in other areas. It didn't help either that Avery Bradley was on fire and chucked up 13 three-pointers. Smart will continue to be a decent contributor for Boston off of the bench in a multitude of statistical categories.

          Olynyk is usually the odd man out when Jared Sullinger and Amir Johnson are healthy, but he actually outscored both of them combined on Wednesday. Olynyk's ability to hit the three-point shot makes him a deadly weapon in Boston's prolific offense, but unfortunately, his role hinges on whatever else is going on with the roster.

          Turner continues to be a key ingredient in the Celtics' rotation, and on Wednesday, he scored double-digit points for the fifth straight game. Turner will help you across the board in every statistical category, but coming off the bench certainly limits his fantasy production.

          The Celtics pulled away in the second half, which gave coach Brad Stevens the luxury of using most of his lineup.

          Amir Johnson (personal) was able to rejoin the Celtics in time for the game and took back his spot in the starting five, resulting in Olynyk moving back to the bench.

          It's unclear exactly what's keeping Johnson from playing, but he's away from the team Friday, and Kelly Olynyk will start in his place. Coach Brad Stevens said the team hopes to have Johnson back in time for Sunday's meeting with the 76ers in Philadelphia, but with a major winter storm set to slam the Atlantic shore this weekend, it's unclear whether traveling will be an issue. As a result, consider Johnson questionable to play Sunday.

Johnson is only expected to miss one game, but given the weather headed toward the East Coast, his ability to rejoin the team for Sunday's game in Philadelphia may be affected.

          Turner's knee soreness didn't force him to miss any games, but he has been less effective of late. Over his last five games, the former Buckeye forward is averaging 4.6 points, 4.4 assists, 3.6 rebounds, and 0.4 steals in 25 minutes per contest. Though his assist numbers are up a little in comparison to his season average, the rest of his counting stats are down. For all his positional versatility, it's clear Turner takes a back seat to Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Marcus Smart, and Jae Crowder. As a result, Turner's fantasy value is limited to deeper leagues unless or until an injury occurs.

It appears coach Brad Stevens has made a more concerted effort to shorten his rotation lately, and that should continue to work to the advantage of Bradley. However, the shooting guard is averaging only 2.4 rebounds, 1.7 assists, and 1.5 steals on the campaign, so when his shot isn't falling, it's often difficult to wring much fantasy value out of him.

While he hasn't posted strong fantasy production in either of his last two contests, Smart was a bulldog defensively Monday night, which has been his calling card during his brief time in the NBA. Avery Bradley (hip) was sidelined Monday and is expected to miss at least the next two games, so Smart could be called upon for more extensive court time, though it appears coach Brad Stevens is content to roll with Evan Turner as Bradley's replacement in the starting five.

          The production wasn't impressive considering how many minutes Olynyk received, but the playing time he was afforded at least demonstrated the trust coach Brad Stevens has in the rangy big man.

However, Smart saw only 13 minutes, and will be eased back into a full load of minutes.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/101161" class="ng-binding">Johnson (foot) will get the start Saturday against the Pistons, the Boston Herald's Steve Bulpett reports.</a></strong><br><br>
          Johnson should find his way to 20-plus minutes Saturday, as David Lee (sore back) has been ruled out. The veteran forward is a better real life player than fantasy asset, and Jared Sullinger might be a better option for owners looking to profit off Lee's absence.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/101135" class="ng-binding">Lee has been ruled out Saturday against the Pistons with a sore lower back.</a></strong><br><br>
          He had been on a nice roll, scoring at least 10 points with at least seven rebounds in two straight games. Look for Jared Sullinger and Kelly Olynyk to see extended run Saturday. It is unclear if this will be just a one night absence or if it could force him to miss multiple games. His next chance to play will be Sunday at home against the Knicks.

          Obviously take that possibility with a large grain of salt, as that is probably the best case scenario for a player who has spent more than a month recovering. A more realistic return date would be Wednesday against the Lakers or next Saturday against the Nets.

          Johnson has missed the previous two games for Boston, but appears on track to return Saturday. He is expected to be reevaluated after shootaround, but that all indications are that he will be good to go for the game. Expect an update on his status when further confirmation is made.

          Sullinger returned from a one-game absence due to back spasms, and he started alongside Kelly Olynyk with Amir Johnson (foot) sitting out. Though Sully didn't shoot the ball well, he still managed to fill up the box score with 10 rebounds, five helpers, two takeaways and one swat. The Celtics' power forward and center positions are deep, but Sullinger has established himself as a starter in coach Brad Stevens' rotation.

          Olynyk earned the start alongside Jared Sullinger in place of Amir Johnson (foot), and he did not disappoint. Olynyk has often shown us glimpses of glory, especially on offense. Still, unless Johnson remains out for an extended period of time, Olynyk may be unlikely to receive 30 minutes all that often given the Celtics' depth down low.

          Lee had a quality showing in his usual limited time on the floor. His name has been in the trade rumor mill a bit of late, but unless Lee gets dealt, his value will likely be capped due to the Celtics' depth down low and his ineffectiveness on defense.

          Crowder dropped his third double-double in a row on Wednesday while helping lead his team to victory. Despite misfiring on all five of his three-point attempts, he shot the ball well from the field and was a beast on the boards. Crowder continues to provide serviceable stats as the Celtics' starting small forward, and he is in the midst of the best month of his NBA career.
