George was already to go-to guy for the Pacers, but if Monta Ellis and George Hill shoot the ball like they did Monday then Indiana will have to lean on him even more.

          George was a sole bright spot in coach Frank Vogel's rotation, as the Pacers were outscored 35-18 in the second quarter of Wednesday's rout.

While Hill brings a more polished offensive skill set to the table, Mahinmi is the superior interior defender, an attribute that should enable him to stick in a starting role.

          Miles awoke from the dead on Wednesday in a big way. His 27 points were a firm reminder that he can be a formidable threat in the Pacers' offense when called upon. We shouldn't expect this type of drastic output from Miles on a consistent basis going forward, and it should be noted that this came against one of the worst defenses in the NBA. The Pacers are running a wide array of rotations out on the court each night, so this performance isn't one to tell all your friends about.

          Miles has seen fewer than 20 minutes in both of the last two contests, which has coincided with George Hill's return from a three-game absence for personal reasons. The Pacers rely on Miles primarily for three-point production, and with the wing shooting a terrible 21.7 percent from distance in January, there's little reason for coach Frank Vogel to give him extended run. Miles is beginning to lose court to the likes of youngsters Glenn Robinson and Joe Young.

          Hill had started three of the Pacers' previous four games at center while Ian Mahinmi (ankle) remained sidelined, but slotted back into his usual reserve role when Mahinmi was cleared to rejoin the lineup. Mahinmi ended up churning out a double-double in 29 minutes while Myles Turner provided 16 points in 18 minutes off the bench, leaving little room for Hill to make an impressive of his own. It looks like Turner has surpassed Hill as the Pacers' top big man off the bench, and the rookie's role will likely only continue to grow during the second half of the season.

George did his best to stay aggressive on offense--as evidenced by his 14 visits to the charity stripe--and keep the Pacers within striking distance on a night where DeMarcus Cousins turned in an otherwordly performance.

          Shortly after being ruled out of Friday's outing versus the Warriors, coach Frank Vogel went on to say that Mahinmi won't play on Saturday either. Mahinmi remains without a concrete timetable for a return, but following his upcoming two-game absence, his next opportunity to return will be Tuesday against the Clippers. With Mahinmi out Friday and Saturday, look for Myles Turner to join the starting lineup and see a large chunk of minutes in his place.

          Mahinmi suffered a sprained ankle during Tuesday's game against the Suns and is experiencing some significant swelling. He'll sit out of Friday's matchup with the Warriors in order to further recover from the injury. With Mahinmi on the sideline, look for Myles Turner to move into the starting lineup in his place, while Jordan Hill and LaVoy Allen could see extended minutes in the frontcourt as well.

          The Pacers haven't provided much clarity this week regarding when Hill might rejoin the team, but it sounds like they've finally gleaned some more information about their point guard's availability. While he'll skip his third straight contest Friday, at this time, it looks like he's on course to take back his starting role a night later and should immediately be capable of playing nearly 35 minutes per game alongside fellow backcourt mate Monta Ellis. Hill's return will push Glenn Robinson back to a bench role.

          Mahinmi suffered a sprained ankle late in the first half of Tuesday's game diving for a loose ball and was unable to return to the floor. Although the Pacers will have two full days off before their matchup with the Warriors, Mahinmi will be working back from his second left foot injury in the last week. If he's unable to play Friday, look for Myles Turner to get the start in his place as he filled in admirably for Mahinmi on Tuesday.

          The Pacers initially gave a two-week timetable for Stuckey after he aggravated a foot injury on Jan. 12, so their decision to rule him out Friday does not necessarily mean that the reserve guard has suffered any setbacks, but rather that he is still rehabbing the injury. With George Hill (personal) also sidelined, the Pacers are thinned out in the back court, but their absence has allowed rookie Joseph Young to see some valuable minutes off the bench.

          Turner started the second half after Ian Mahinmi went down with a sprained left ankle in the final minute of the second quarter. Mahinmi is being listed as questionable for Friday's game against the Warriors, so Turner would likely receive the start in the event Mahinmi can't go. The rookie appears to have surpassed Jordan Hill in the Pacers' frontcourt rotation after turning up his production the last three games.

          Hill's absence is set to drag on for the third game of Indiana's four-game road swing as he continues to miss time to tend to a personal matter. There is no word on whether Hill will even join the team in the near future, so his status for Saturday's game in Sacramento could be up in the air as well.

          Hill is not with the team for personal reasons, so the Pacers will be without him for Sunday's outing with the Nuggets. It isn't expected to keep him sidelined for a long period of time and he could be back as early as Tuesday's game against the Suns. Monta Ellis should see increased minutes at point guard in his absence, while Joseph Young will likely be the main backup with Rodney Stuckey (foot) sidelined as well.

          George experienced pain in his right knee during Friday's loss to the Wizards, but only required a brief break from the court before finishing with 21 points and seven assists across 34 minutes. After taking Saturday off to recover, it looks like the swingman will be in line for his usual workload against the Nuggets, and could be in line for even heavier offensive usage if point guard George Hill -- who is questionable for the contest due to personal reasons -- ends up sitting out.

Hill, who missed Friday's shootaround but was ultimately able to play against the Wizards, may not be with the team for Sunday's game against the Nuggets. According to Taylor, it's "unclear" whether Hill will play Sunday or wait to rejoin the team Tuesday in Phoenix. If Hill does not play Sunday, look for Monta Ellis to see some time at point guard.

The quick turnaround certainly won't help Mahinmi's chances of being available Wednesday, but the Pacers will check in on his condition closer to game time before reaching a decision on his availability.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/101139" class="ng-binding">Miles (back) will not play Monday against the Hawks, Chris Vivlamore of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.</a></strong><br><br>
          Miles is dealing with soreness in his lower back, and he'll be held out Monday as the Pacers seek their second straight win after beating Minnesota on Saturday. Miles was limited to just six points and one steal in 17 minutes against the Wolves. Lavoy Allen will enter the starting lineup in Miles' place as Paul George shifts down to small forward.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/101145" class="ng-binding">Ellis is listed as questionable to play Monday against the Hawks due to a sore right knee, Chris Vivlamore of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.</a></strong><br><br>
          Ellis has been dealing with soreness in the knee, on and off, for nearly two weeks, but the issue has not caused him to miss any time, and he played 36 minutes in Saturday's win over the Timberwolves. The shooting guard will likely go through a pregame workout before determining whether or not he'll play Monday night, so check back prior to the 7:00 PM ET tip off for a more definitive update.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/1626167" class="ng-binding">Turner (finger) underwent an X-ray Monday and has been cleared to return to full activity.</a></strong><br><br>
          Turner took part in shootaround Monday morning, but he was held out of 5-on-5 work, instead going through shooting drills off to the side. While the rookie has been medically cleared to play, the Pacers won't throw him back into the fire immediately, and coach Frank Vogel all but ruled him out for Monday's game against the Hawks. "We're going to take it day by day," Vogel said. "He'll be in uniform tonight but very unlikely to play." Turner could end up missing a game or two as he works his way back, but at this point it appears he'll be back on the court sooner rather than later. Assuming he doesn't play Monday, his return could come as early as Wednesday in Chicago.
