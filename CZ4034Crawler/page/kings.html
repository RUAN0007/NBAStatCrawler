          The veteran reserve continues to receive an abundance of playing time off the bench, with Friday's tally representing the third game he's played 30 minutes or more in seven February games. Collison was typically efficient in posting his eighth straight contest with double-digit scoring, and recording multiple steals for the third time in the last five outings.

          The All-Star big man was in top form coming out of the break, easily dominating a Nuggets frontcourt known to be susceptible down low. Cousins scored 24 of his points in the first half, and broke a franchise record previously held by Chris Webber by posting his ninth career double-double with 20-plus points and rebounds. It was also already his fourth double-double in just seven February contests that he's been active for.

He even thrived on defense, often frustrating rookie Emmanuel Mudiay and recording multiple thefts for the seventh straight contest.

It's not the easiest spot playing behind one of the best point guards in the NBA, but Wednesday's performance should enlighten George Karl, or whoever will be coaching the Kings going forward, that Collison deserves more time on the court.

          Cousins struggled early on Wednesday against the Sixers, but he eventually got it going like always. In his first run of minutes, Boogie was a bit passive and only put up one shot from the field in the first quarter. Once he returned to the game in the second quarter, Cousins got to the free-throw line eight times and that really boosted his scoring output. While it seems like the world is falling down around him, Cousins is still one of the best centers in the NBA and should be deployed in every fantasy format.

The Kings are falling apart at the seams a little more each day, and Rondo continues to operate this offense in a smooth manner. In the last four games, Rondo has amassed 15 assists three times and the one time he didn't, he had 16 of them. Rondo is in the midst of a career-best season where he's averaging 11.9 assists per game and there's no reason at all for him not to be in your lineup.

          McLemore's wrist injury kept him out of Monday's win over the Bucks and though he was able to play the following game Friday, he was limited to just 12 minutes off the bench. If he misses the Kings' game against the Celtics, Marco Belinelli could make another start at shooting guard.

          Rondo got off to a great start in this game, scoring 11 points in the first quarter, but only four for the remainder of the game. His rebounds have inexplicably gone down in the month of February, as he's had only five of them in three games. Rondo will continue to be a major part of the offense moving forward, and there's no cause for concern with the lack of rebounds because the production will come in other areas. Rondo's next matchup on Sunday will inspire some added incentive as the Kings take on the Celtics in Boston. Look for Rondo to have a little more pep in his step than usual.

          Collison was the beneficiary of the Kings going to a smaller lineup late, and the 25 points were a season-high for him. If DFS players thought Rajon Rondo was going to miss this game with a turf toe injury, they certainly lucked out in this contest. The turf toe injury is something to look out for with Rondo going forward because Collison would certainly swallow up all of his minutes. Collison can remain on the waiver wire for now in season-long leagues, but will become valuable should any injuries occur within the main rotation of the Kings' backcourt.

          Cousins missed Monday's game against the Grizzlies after suffering a sprained ankle in the Kings' previous outing. He's now being listed as questionable heading into Wednesday's matchup with the Bulls, but considering he took part in practice on Tuesday, it bodes well for his chances of playing.

          Cousins was held out of Monday's win over the Bucks after spraining his left ankle over the weekend, but his presence at practice Tuesday is certainly an encouraging sign. However, Ham notes that it was only a light session, so Cousins' availability for Wednesday's matchup with Chicago is still very much up in the air.

Rondo had gone 4-for-10 from long range over the last four games and is shooting only 37.9 percent from downtown on the season, so while Monday's level of proficiency can't be expected going forward, the point guard has still shown more of a willingness to look for his own shot lately.

The elevated playing time helped him return to the customary jaw-dropping numbers he's generated throughout January, with Cousins posting his 12th double-double in the past 13 contests and recording a season-high five rejections. The 25-year-old will look to put a cap on an MVP-caliber month in which he's averaged 32.6 points and 12.8 rebounds in the Kings' Saturday tilt against the Grizzlies.

The reduction in overall involvement on offense resulted in the normally aggressive Casspi only taking seven shot attempts, after averaging 10 per game over the previous three contests. His three tries from beyond the arc, all misses, were a low for the month of Janaury as well, and resulted in the 27-year-old failing to register a three-pointer for the first time since Dec. 10 against the Knicks.

          After he was downgraded to doubtful earlier Saturday, Gay's absence isn't unexpected. While he continues to tend to a left heel contusion, Omri Casspi is the leading candidate to get the nod at small forward.

          There's not much more than can be said about the dominant 25-year-old, who's now posted nine straight double-doubles and 10 in his last 11 games. Cousins has already been deemed the best center in the league by coach George Karl, and with rookie Willie Cauley-Stein beginning to prosper in his own right, the pair is developing into one of the most formidable frontcourt tandems in the league. Cousins is now posting outstanding averages of 30.9 points and 13.8 rebounds in January, while shooting 48.9 percent from the field and 47.1 percent from beyond the arc.

          The seven-year veteran got the starting call for the ailing Rudy Gay (heel), and provided solid production on both ends of the floor. Casspi's five steals were a season high, and he drained multiple three-pointers for the second time in three contests. If Gay is forced to miss any further time, Casspi could serve as an excellent source of multi-category fantasy production in all formats. During a month of December in which he averaged a robust 35.3 minutes per contest, the 27-year-old averaged 15.4 points, 7.5 rebounds and 1.9 assists over 12 games.

          It's the first career double-double for Cauley-Stein, who joined DeMarcus Cousins (36 points, 16 boards) in demolishing an overmatched Lakers frontcourt. Cauley-Stein seems to have adapted well to his role as a frontcourt starter alongside Cousins, but because of his limited offensive repertoire in the low post, he'll likely be a single-digit scorer more often than not. Still, his skills as a shot blocker and rebounder give him value in deep, two-center formats.

While the outing was a pleasant surprise, it's important to keep in mind that McLemore rarely takes enough shots to approximate even modest double-digit scoring totals, with his eight attempts Saturday serving as only the second time he's shot over five times in the last 12 games.

          McLemore was benched in favor of Marco Belinelli for the start of the second half and could be on the cusp of falling from the top spot on the Kings' depth chart at shooting guard. Despite coming off the bench throughout the season, Belinelli has provided much more of a scoring punch than McLemore, who is averaging just 7.4 points and 0.8 three-pointers over 20.8 minutes per game on the campaign. It might not be long before coach George Karl elects to turn in the direction of Belinelli or another player for the starting shooting guard job.

          Koufos ended up running with the starters out of the halftime break, replacing Quincy Acy at power forward. Despite that appointment, Koufos actually saw a couple fewer minutes than he's been averaging for the season (21.3), so even if he ends up receiving the starting nod for Thursday's game against the Jazz, he's far from a safe bet to see a substantial increase in court time.

          Though he was able to retain his spot in the starting five despite the return of Omri Casspi (back) on Wednesday, Acy provided little production in the first half and didn't enter the second half with the starters. Instead, it was Kosta Koufos who got the nod, but it's expected that Casspi will eventually take back the top spot on the depth chart once he becomes further removed from the back injury. As it stands right now, Acy is no better than third on the pecking order at power forward behind Casspi and Koufos, which could ultimately result in him getting pushed out of the rotation entirely during Thursday's game against the Jazz.

The trey he provided in Wednesday's loss was just his second during that six-game span, and his continued struggles from the free-throw line will always make clearing 15 points a regular challenge, though he was able to achieve that against the Pelicans thanks to better-than-normal efficiency from the field.

          In a surprising decision, coach George Karl stuck with Quincy Acy as his starting power forward, but Casspi still ended up dominating the playing time at the position, seeing 29 minutes to Acy's nine. It's likely that Casspi will take back the starting job eventually, but even if he remains deployed in a bench role over the next few games, he'll still see starter-level playing time. Though he didn't shoot the ball particularly efficiently Wednesday, Casspi had been providing steady production in points, three-pointers, rebounds, and field-goal percentage prior to suffering the injury, so it's worthwhile for fantasy owners to exercise some patience with the forward while he gets acclimated.

          Omri Casspi's multi-game absence as a result of a back injury afforded Acy a starting opportunity for the second straight game, and he managed to make good use of the extra minutes. The four-year pro posted his second-straight double-digit scoring performance at the power forward spot, and notably equaled his season-high with 25 minutes after only tallying 16 minutes in his first start against the Mavericks. The former Knick was nearly perfect from the field and solid on the glass as well, giving him some serviceable fantasy stat lines over the last pair of contests. However, his tenure in the starting five figures to come to an end as soon as Casspi is healthy enough to return, keeping him as a sneaky punt play in daily formats at most for the time being.

Although he's enjoyed more prolific scoring nights this season, Thursday's performance was likely Cousins' most well-rounded on the campaign. The seven assists were a season-high, and he also managed multiple three-pointers for the third straight contest.

However, despite the Kings dealing with numerous injuries in addition to the fact that the game required two extra periods, McLemore didn't see much change in his court time, as he was actually slightly under the 20.9 minutes he's been averaging for the campaign. Instead, it was Seth Curry (36 minutes) and Marco Belinelli (43 minutes) that both picked up some extra court time, demonstrating that McLemore may be more of a placeholder for the first unit than anything else.

It's especially troubling that Acy couldn't even make a push for 30 minutes despite the Kings' multiple injuries along with the fact that the game went two extra periods. The lack of usage indicates that Acy just isn't viewed as an integral member of the Kings' rotation, so his minutes shouldn't be counted on to increase even if he continues to remain in the starting lineup during any future games Casspi might miss.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/1626161" class="ng-binding">Cauley-Stein (finger) has been ruled out of Tuesday's game against the Mavericks, James Ham of CSN Bay Area reports.</a></strong><br><br>
          Cauley-Stein suffered a laceration to his right middle finger on Monday, which ended up requiring three stitches. The injury will force him to sit out Tuesday, which likely means extended minutes for Kosta Koufos and Quincy Acy in the frontcourt. Cauley-Stein's next opportunity to play will be Thursday against the Lakers, so consider him questionable for that outing at this point in time.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/200765" class="ng-binding">Rondo (back) is listed as doubtful for Tuesday's matchup with the Mavericks, Marc J. Spears of Yahoo! Sports reports.</a></strong><br><br>
          It is unlikely that Rondo will get to play in his first game back in Dallas since leaving the Mavericks. An official decision may be postponed until after team warmups in order to monitor how Rondo is feeling. If Rondo is out, look for Darren Collison to pick up the start, with the possibility of Seth Curry seeing more action.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/203463" class="ng-binding">McLemore (back) is listed as questionable for Tuesday's matchup with the Mavericks, Jason Jones of the Sacramento Bee reports.</a></strong><br><br>
          McLemore had to leave Monday's game with back spasms and they continue to cause him some discomfort. A ruling has yet to be made on his status for Tuesday's outing with the Mavericks, so we'll likely have to wait till closer to pregame warmups before a decision on his availability is made. With Rajon Rondo also doubtful to play due to a back injury, Darren Collison, Marco Belinelli and Seth Curry all could see extended minutes in the backcourt.

          A sore back kept Casspi out of Monday's win over the Thunder, and with the Kings foregoing shootaround Tuesday morning, the team is yet to provide an update on the forward's status. As such, he should be considered a game-time decision until further notice. Casspi has played well of late, averaging 17.6 points and 9.0 rebounds while shooting 56.4 percent from the field and 56.3 percent from three over his last five games.

          The injury flew under the radar because Dukan hasn't been a part of the Kings' rotation this season, as the undrafted rookie is still waiting to make his NBA debut. Unfortunately for Dukan, the injury couldn't come at a poorer time, as the Kings are low on healthy bodies with Eric Moreland (foot) out for several weeks and Ben McLemore (back), Omri Casspi (back), and Willie Cauley-Stein (finger) all banged up. It's uncertain how long Dukan will be sidelined with his injury.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/202326" class="ng-binding">Cousins recorded 33 points (11-27 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 9-10 FT), 19 rebounds, two blocks, and one assist in 38 minutes during the Kings' 116-104 win versus the Thunder on Monday.</a></strong><br><br>
          Cousins didn't shoot an amazing percentage from the field, but he turned the ball over only once on his way to posting game-highs in scoring and rebounding. When he has his head on straight, Cousins is a force to be reckoned with on both ends of the floor. Over the last five games, he is averaging 25.8 points (47.1 FG, 31.3 3Pt, 75.0 FT), 9.8 rebounds, 1.4 assists, 1.4 blocks, and one steal in 30 minutes per game despite seeing only 12 minutes of action versus the Warriors due to foul trouble and his eventual ejection.
