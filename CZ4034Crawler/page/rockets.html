          Worries about Motiejunas' ongoing back injury are what prompted the voiding, as the Pistons were simply too concerned about his long-term health. It's a bet of a messy situation for the three teams - Detroit, Houston and Philadelphia - involved in last Thursday's deal, but all three players who were on the move will return to their original teams. That means Motiejunas and Marcus Thornton will go back to Houston, while Joel Anthony will return to Detroit after Houston had subsequently shipped him to the 76ers after acquiring him from Detroit. Philadelphia will also get the second-round pick it traded for Anthony back from Houston.

The 28-year-old point guard is producing career-lows across almost every statistical category, and barring injuries or a trade, it's tough to picture Lawson turning things around this season.

It doesn't look to be anything serious, however, as Harden went through shootaround and is not listed, in any capacity, on the Rockets' injury report. Harden is coming off of a 33-point, eight-rebound performances Saturday, though he committed a season-high 10 turnovers in 36 minutes.

The "Hack-a-Howard" isn't as effective as it once was, and that's no longer an acceptable excuse to not roster him anymore. Howard is obviously on your season-long rosters, but his sudden surge at the charity stripe can make him a must-start in DFS circles any day now.

          Motiejunas played with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers over the weekend, but had since returned to practice with the Rockets earlier this week as he nears his return from a back injury. The plan is for Motiejunas to play for the Vipers on their upcoming two-game road trip Thursday and Saturday before returning to Houston on Sunday. Assuming Motiejunas does not suffer any sort of setback, he could return to game action for the Rockets as early as Tuesday, when the team kicks off a five-game road swing against the defending champion Warriors.

          In his latest game with the Vipers on Thursday, McDaniels finished with 16 points (6-12 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 3-4 FT), six rebounds and six assists over 36 minutes. The second-year pro out of Clemson has seen action in just 15 games with the Rockets this year, so despite being recalled, he'll likely struggle to see the court.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/2730" class="ng-binding">Howard is dealing with a sprained left ankle and is officially out for Friday's game against the Bucks, Mark Berman of Fox 26 reports.</a></strong><br><br>
          Howard underwent an MRI on Wednesday as a precaution to ensure the ankle injury isn't anything serious, but the sprain will force him to be sidelined Friday when the Rockets host the Bucks. The injury occurred during Wednesday's tilt with the Pistons just 55 seconds into the game, and it could keep him out for multiple games depending on the severity. Expect Terrence Jones and Clint Capela to acquire increased minutes, while Howard's next chance to return comes Sunday against the Mavericks.

          Even though center Dwight Howard departed less than a minute into Wednesday's game with an ankle sprain, Jones didn't benefit from a tremendous jump in playing time, as he had seen between 20 and 22 minutes in the prior three games. In any event, Jones still made the most of his time on the court by missing only one shot while showcasing his ability to light it up from downtown. If Howard ends up missing Friday's game against the Bucks, Jones could be in line to get the start at power forward, while Clint Capela would assume Howard's center spot.

          It's never a good sign when fouls are the highest counting stat for a player, especially when he sees such sizable playing time. But that's precisely what happened to Ariza, who was unable to do anything with the added minutes that he received as a domino effect of Dwight Howard (ankle) departing 55 seconds into the contest. Ariza's lack of shooting accuracy proved to be his biggest enemy Wednesday, and though he had shown improvement in that regard in a few of the preceding contests, it remains the primary reason why he's failed to reach his preseason projections. His 39.5 percent mark from the field is his lowest since the 2009-10 campaign.

          McDaniels and rookie Montrezl Harrell (nine minutes, five fouls) were interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff's designated hackers for the night, as the Rockets actively attempted to neutralize Pistons center Andre Drummond by sending him to the free-throw line. The strategy worked to an extent -- Drummond missed an NBA-record 23 free throws out of his 36 attempts -- but the rest of the Pistons went 22-of-23 from the charity stripe to beat the Rockets in comfortable fashion.

          Terry was unable to go through shootaround Sunday morning, which doesn't bode well for his chances to play Sunday night against the Lakers. With Pat Beverley also questionable because of an ankle injury, an absence from Terry could leave the Rockets short-handed in the backcourt. With both Terry and Beverley dealing with their respective injuries, Ty Lawson could be relied upon for some extra minutes Sunday. We should see Terry's status updated sometime closer to tip-off.

He was also outstanding from beyond the arc for the third straight contest, and has managed a stellar 58.8 percent success rate from long range over that span. While his scoring totals are typically modest and he's not a traditional high-assist point guard, Beverley serves as a nice mid-tier option that often supplements his fantasy production with solid and consistent steal totals.

          Motiejunas has already missed two games with back soreness but fortunately a recent MRI didn't reveal any significant damage. The forward has a long history of back ailments, however, so the Rockets will be erring on the side of caution as to not re-injure a herniated disk which was surgically repaired last year.

          Lawson was not questionable heading into Monday's game, so this news is a bit surprising. The Rockets have indicated he is day-to-day, which means he may be ready to return Thursday, as he will have three days to rest. Expect an update on his status when more information is made available.

          Thornton did not even travel to Utah with his teammates, as he will get Monday off following the birth of his child. Thornton will presumably be able to return to action for the Rockets' rematch with the Jazz on Thursday in Houston.

          Motiejunas is dealing with a sore back and will sit out a second consecutive game on Monday. With Motiejunas on the sideline, look for Terrence Jones and Clint Capela to see an increase in their playing time. He didn't travel with the Rockets on their road trip, so his next opportunity to play will be in Thursday's game against the Jazz.
