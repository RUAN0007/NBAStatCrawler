          Mudiay sank two three-pointers and scored 18 points on only nine shots, but he committed four turnovers while dishing only three assists. His turnover troubles allowed the Celtics to get easy buckets in transition, and as a result Boston blew Denver out. However, Kenneth Faried played only 13 minutes due to illness, and the Nuggets were simply outmanned against a deeper, more seasoned squad. Mudiay turns 20 on Mar. 5, and he is experiencing plenty of growing pains this season, but that is to be expected of any player entering the NBA at such a young age.

          Harris missed all four attempts from beyond the arc, but he swiped three steals and saw a hefty load of minutes once again. Over the last five games, he is averaging 12 points on 46 percent from the field to go with three assists, 2.8 rebounds, and two steals in 39 minutes per contest. However, if he were hitting on more than 17 percent of his 3.6 three-point attempts over that span, he'd be torching box scores enough to be a must-own player in most formats. The departure of Randy Foye at the trade deadline likely ensures Harris will continue seeing a lot of minutes over the last 26 games of 2015-16, and he has definitely shown the potential to fill it up on occasion.

          Gallinari came out of the All-Star break ready to attack the basket, and essentially made the most of his 13 visits to the charity stripe. It was notably already the fourth time in seven February games that Gallinari has made double-digit free-throw attempts, which he's converted at a 90 percent clip to date in the month. He's also working on a 10-game streak with at least one three-pointer, and looks primed to continue building on what is already the best season of his career over the second portion of the campaign. Given his role as the linchpin of the Denver offense, Gallinari continues to be a near-elite option at forward in all fantasy formats.

          The second-year big man had shown flashes earlier in the season while receiving a solid allotment of minutes during Kenneth Faried's absence, but Friday's outing was his most efficient by far. It was notably the third game in the last four that Lauvergne received over 20 minutes on the floor, a sign that coach Mike Malone may be warming to the idea of unleashing the 24-year-old over the second part of the season to further his development. Lauvergne seems to offer a higher ceiling than fellow reserve Darrell Arthur, and his usage will be something for fantasy owners to monitor over the course of the next few games.

That would enable Novak to sign on with a new team, likely a contender, as the 32-year-old has expressed his desire to join a playoff-caliber club. Of course, another team would have to agree to take absorb Novak into an empty roster spot, but there figures to be interest given Novak's reputation as a sharpshooter and solid teammate.

          Augustin had struggled to receive any playing time as a reserve point guard in Oklahoma City leading up to the All-Star break, and he'll likely assume a similar role as third-string point guard in Denver behind Emmanuel Mudiay and Jameer Nelson. Through 34 appearances with the Thunder this season, Augustin has averaged 4.2 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 1.9 assists in 15 minutes per game. The trade likely won't have much relevance in terms of Augustin's lack of fantasy value, although he should be in line for more minutes than he was getting with the Thunder.

          Hickson has been active lately with Wilson Chandler (hip), Jameer Nelson (wrist), and Darrell Arthur (quad) occupying spots on the inactive list, but those absences haven't cleared the way for more playing time for the 27-year-old.

          Faried picked up four fouls that allowed Joffrey Lauvergne to earn some more court time off the bench, resulting in Faried seeing his fewest minutes since Jan. 25. Coach Mike Malone remains reluctant to hand Faried 30-plus minutes on a regular basis, but he seems to have made the most of his depressed court time lately. He's recorded at least 11 points in the last seven games, while averaging 8.6 rebounds and shooting 67.2 percent from the floor in that stretch.

          Nurkic's 16 points, 11 boards, and 24 minutes were all season highs, and this was the Nuggets' second double-double of 2015-16. The Nuggets have no shortage of centers either. Rookie Nikola Jokic saw 25 minutes as the starter, and the split in playing time was basically dead-even between those two on Wednesday. However, coach Mike Malone does opt to pair the bigs together quite a bit, as evidenced by Joffrey Lauvergne seeing 21 minutes as well.

          Gallinari struggled mightily from the field in the close loss. However, as per usual, he did a fantastic job of drawing fouls and earning free-throw attempts. Gallo gained half of his points at the charity stripe, which is a good sign that he can put up decent scoring totals even when he has an off night. He has scored 20 or more points in 13 of 17 appearances since re-joining the lineup to start 2016, and he is hands down the team's top option on offense.

          Something seems to have clicked for Jokic. He's scored in double digits in four of his last five games and grabbed double-digit boards in three of his last four. The steals are also a new career high for the rookie and Jokic has been surprisingly useful in that category lately, nabbing a steal in eight straight games and averaging 1.5 steals a game in January.

In Nelson's absence, Gary Harris, Randy Foye and 10-day contract signee Sean Kilpatrick have filled in behind starter Emmanuel Mudiay.

The former Kansas standout played just 10 minutes against Boston on Wednesday night, going scoreless (0-3 FG) with a pair of rebounds and an assist.

On the second night of a road back-to-back, the Nuggets will likely wait until later in the day to evaluate Jokic, but if he's ultimately held out, the Nuggets could be shorthanded down low. Joffrey Lauvergne (toe) sat out Wednesday's game and if both he and Jokic end up missing contest, Jusuf Nurkic and J.J. Hickson would be the lone healthy centers available.

          The second-year pro was outstanding on the defensive end in particular, with the five steals representing a season high. It was also Harris' seventh double-digit scoring performance in the last eight contests, and he extended his streak of draining at least one three-pointer to 14 consecutive games. Although he still struggles with consistency in his scoring from time to time, coach Mike Malone appears intent on allowing Harris to develop in the starting role and continue to bring Will Barton off the bench.

          Jokic will benefit Sunday from the absence of Jusuf Nurkic (knee) since Nurkic tends to start when all options are healthy. At just 20 years old, Jokic is always a double-double threat whenever he sees ample time on the court, and things are lining up in his favor for the time being.

He won't be available Sunday, however, with Emmanuel Mudiay appears poised to retake the starting role and extra minutes in his place, with Randy Foye potentially seeing a few added minutes as well.

          Nurkic's dismissive comments about the injury would lead us to believe that he suffered a Grade 1 ankle sprain, which would likely result in a multi-day absence rather than a multi-week one.

Nurkic has been limited to just six appearances this season after recently returning from offseason knee surgery, so the Nuggets could be motivated to proceed a little more cautiously with the big man than they normally would.

          Mudiay had been expected to return from a nearly month-long absence at some point last week, but the sprained ankle ended up lingering a little longer than anticipated, extending the rookie's absence to 14 games. He'll immediately reclaim his spot atop the Nuggets' depth chart, as fill-in starter Jameer Nelson (hip) will be sidelined by injury. Given Nelson's unavailability, Mudiay could be in line for 30 minutes right off the bat, with reserve guard Randy Foye picking up the remainder of the playing time at point guard.

Mudiay had struggled with his shooting and was turning the ball over at a high rate prior to hitting the shelf, so there will likely still be room for Nelson to pick up ample run off the bench once he's healthy. However, the veteran will still see his playing time decline significantly from the 30-plus minutes he regularly logged when Mudiay was sidelined.

He managed over 20 points after having failed to do so in the last four games before he was sidelined, and spearheaded a Nuggets attack that was almost strong enough to conquer the short-handed Warriors on their home court. Now that Gallinari is apparently back at full strength, he once again becomes an outstanding fantasy option with the potential to explode for top-tier scoring numbers on any given night if he gets the hot hand.

          The 24-year-old endured a rough night from the field to nevertheless make outstanding contributions across the stat sheet while playing a season high in minutes. Although his shooting night qualified as his poorest since a 30-percent effort against the Mavericks back on Nov. 28, Barton's 13 boards (12 on the defensive glass) were a season high, as were the seven dimes he dished out. His active presence all over the court helped Denver keep pace with the amazing performance put forth by Draymond Green, and was almost enough to help the Nuggets pull off the road upset of the reigning champs. Barton has become an outstanding fantasy option despite technically coming off the bench, as his minutes and production continue to be starter-quality.

Arthur's solid shooting night helped net him only his second double-digit scoring performance over the last 12 games that he's participated in. If he does draw some starting assignments in Faried's stead, Arthur may become a short-term fantasy option for those desperate for some forward help, and a solid near-minimum option in daily formats.

He's done a solid job filling in for the sidelined Emmanuel Mudiay over the last 10 games (with averages of 10.8 points, 4.6 rebounds, 6.2 assists), and has bounced back nicely from a scoreless performance against the Cavliers on Dec. 29 to post back-to-back double-digit scoring performances.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/2749" class="ng-binding">Nelson tallied 15 points (5-11 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT), eight rebounds, and five assists in 43 minutes during the Nuggets' 122-112 loss to the Thunder on Sunday.</a></strong><br><br>
          Nelson continues to start and earn extended minutes with Emmanuel Mudiay (ankle) injured. For those looking for production at point guard in the short term, look no further than Nelson, as he is likely to keep seeing plenty of minutes until Mudiay makes his return to action. The 33-year-old veteran is well beyond his prime, but especially in leagues that value counting stats, he could be very useful for at least another week or so.

          Harris continues to receive the most minutes on the team at shooting guard, and though he doesn't typically do much besides score, his playing time figures to be fairly consistent over the course of the season on a Nuggets team looking to develop its young talent. Over the past five contests, the 21-year-old guard is averaging 10.6 points (37.3 FG, 20.0 3Pt, 62.5 FT), 2.6 assists, 2.0 rebounds, 1.2 steals, and 0.4 blocks in 33 minutes per game, so he has been a bit more well-rounded recently. Still, unless those shooting percentages start to rise, Harris' value will likely be limited to deeper leagues.

          The Nuggets were without four players due to injury Saturday, but Hickson unfortunately finds himself as the 11th man in coach Michael Malone's 10-man rotation. Hickson hasn't played since Dec. 8 and should continue to struggle to see the court outside of blowout wins or losses.

          Gallinari suffered a left ankle sprain one week ago in a game against the Pelicans, and it appears the Nuggets are proceeding slowly with their small forward, who has been the team's MVP so far this season. Though he was able to practice Monday, Gallinari has been kept off the court since that time and will take another week off to recover from the injury. He'll miss three additional games before the Nuggets provide an update on his status in advance of the tilt with the Warriors.

          Tack on at least three more games missed for Mudiay, who had already sat out the Nuggets' previous seven games with the ankle injury. There's been little indication that Mudiay is making much progress from the ailment, and his uncertain return timetable coupled with his disappointing production prior to the injury makes the rookie a drop candidate outside of deep or keeper formats.

          Jokic now has posted 20 or more points in two games against the Spurs this season, and has extended his streak of double-digit scoring to four contests. Though he continues to come off the bench, he's generally outproduced Joffrey Lauvergne in the last handful of games and will remain the most fantasy-relevant center on the Nuggets until Jusuf Nurkic (knee) returns.

          After going off for a season-high 31 points while making a spot start at point guard Wednesday for the ill Jameer Nelson, Foye rejoined the second unit and saw a 13-minute reduction in playing time. The Nuggets are dealing with several injuries up and down the roster that could allow Foye to uphold a regular 20-plus minute role for the time being, but he likely won't bring much fantasy value aside from three-point production.

          Miller received a rare start in the Nuggets' previous game Wednesday against the Phoenix when coach Michael Malone opted to play small ball, but with Denver reverting to a more normal configuration Saturday, Joffrey Lauvergne swapped in for Miller. The veteran forward will likely continue to see only limited minutes off the bench as a three-point specialist.

          Lauvergne was dropped from the starting five and didn't play at all in the Nuggets' previous game Wednesday against the Suns, likely due to coach Michael Malone's preference to experiment with more small-ball lineups. With the Spurs presenting more size on the inside with LaMarcus Aldridge, David West, and Boban Marjanovic, Lauvergne was needed for matchup purposes, so he reclaimed a starting role and ended up seeing his most playing time in four games. Even so, Lauvergne's usage has been fairly variable since he returned from a back injury in late November, so it's difficult to count on him for consistent production.

          Nelson missed the Nuggets' previous game Wednesday against the Suns, but was able to recover quickly from the illness and reclaim his starting role Saturday night. However, he ended up seeing his fewest minutes since Dec. 2, despite the continued absence of Emmanuel Mudiay (ankle). Nelson is expected to maintain the top spot on the depth chart while Mudiay remains out, but it's possible he could end up sacrificing some more playing time at point guard to Randy Foye, who scored 31 points while starting in place of Nelson on Wednesday. Foye also finished with more minutes (27) than Nelson on Saturday.
