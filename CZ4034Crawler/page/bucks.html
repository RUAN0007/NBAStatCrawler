          Novak signed with the Bucks on Monday after ultimately being released by the Nuggets on Friday.

Novak was bought out Friday and officially cleared waivers Sunday evening. Per Stein's report, the 32-year-old was en route to Milwaukee, and the signing is expected to become official sometime Monday. Novak, a Milwaukee area native, played only sparingly for the Thunder and hasn't been a regular rotational player in several seasons, but the Bucks are starved for shooting, so it's possible he could see consistent, but ultimately limited, run off the bench over the final third of the season. In order to accommodate Novak on the roster, Milwaukee released Chris Copeland on Sunday.

The Bucks are a very young, but talented, team and there are so many different pieces that sometimes "The Greek Freak" gets lost in the discussion.

Saturday's game going into double overtime certainly helped Parker garner more stats, but it was still an impressive performance nonetheless. It may have taken a while, but the Bucks organization and Parker's fantasy owners are happy that he's finally arrived in a big way. Parker has been playing power forward and that creates a lot of mismatches for the bigger and slower guys that typically fill out that position. Parker is on fire right now, shooting 28-for-51 (55%) from the field in his last three games, and it would be wise to have him on your roster.

          Copeland was brought in over the summer to provide perimeter shooting to one of the league's worst three-point shooting teams, but he's simply been too much of a liability on the defensive end to crack the nightly rotation. Copeland hasn't seen double-digit minutes since mid-November, and he appears destined to toil in a garbage time role for the rest of the season, barring a drastic roster shake-up.

          Antetokounmpo continues to be a major factor for the Bucks and Thursday was no different in the up-tempo matchup against the Wizards. The most beneficial thing about rostering The Greek Freak is that he can get it done in a number of different areas on the stat sheet. On Thursday, his stats weren't as diversified as they usually are, but the 13 rebounds were his second-highest total of the season. It was a little surprising that Antetokounmpo didn't have more stats in this game, but be patient with the oh so talented Greek.

Kidd inserted Mayo in at point guard for Michael Carter-Williams at point guard, while Miles Plumlee replaced Greg Monroe at center. Both Mayo and Plumlee (18 minutes), who have primarily come off the bench this season, still ended up seeing far less court time than Carter-Williams (26 minutes) and Monroe (30 minutes), so Mayo won't make for a strong waiver claim even if he maintains hold on the starting job.

          The third-year pro's shot attempts were down while contending with some Gordon Hawyard defense, but he still managed his 12th double-digit scoring performance in the last 13 games with some efficient shooting. Antetokounmpo has brought a greater measure of consistency in the 2015-16 campaign, and is already averaging a solid 16.7 points, 6.3 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 0.7 blocks and 1.7 steals in three February contests.

          Middleton spearheaded the Bucks offense on a night where they struggled against the Jazz's suffocating defense. The 24-year-old did continue to scuffle from the field, tallying his fifth consecutive sub-40-percent shooting night after only experiencing four over the prior 19 games. Despite the struggles, Middleton continues to provide solid numbers across virtually every category, and will experience a nice uptick when he breaks out of his current shooting slump. A return to a figure closer to the 20.7 points per game he averaged in January while shooting 10 percentage points higher (44 percent) than he currently is in three February games is certainly not out of the question

          Bayless had his best game in over a month on Tuesday, scoring 16 points on nine field goal attempts while playing 30 minutes for just the fourth time in his last 14 appearances.

          On a night where the rest of the offense was sluggish, Monroe responded with his fourth consecutive game with more than 20 points. He was solid on the glass once again as well, and has averaged 9.5 boards over that four-game span. After a somwhat uneven start to his Bucks tenure, Monroe appears to have hit his stride in Milwaukee, and is contributing the same type of numbers that he regularly produced last season while in a Pistons uniform.

          Despite the tough shooting night, Middleton found a way to stuff the stat sheet and turn in a solid defensive game as well. The four-year pro has really hit his stride in January, boosting his points-per-game average (21.5) almost three full points  over his December figure of 18.6, while also managing notable jumps in his rebounds (4.2) and assists (5.2) figures. Middleton's ability to contribute consistently in multiple categories has made him one of the more well-rounded two-guards in the league and also rendered him particularly valuable in all fantasy formats, considering many players at his position are heavily scoring-dependent for fantasy production.

          Bayless, who had missed the previous six games with a sprained left ankle, was quickly able to reclaim a prominent spot in the Bucks' rotation and cut into the workload of starting point guard Michael Carter-Williams. While it's likely that Carter-Williams will continue to start at the position and frequently see more playing time of the two players, Bayless could still settle into a regular 25-to-30 minute role off the bench due to the Bucks' lack of appealing backcourt reserves.

          Monroe ravaged a Pacers frontcourt that played without two of its top three big men in Ian Mahinmi (knee) and Jordan Hill (mouth), clearing 20 points for the first time since Dec. 12 against the Warriors. It's a little troubling that he wasn't active on the glass, but on the heels of three consecutive games in which Monroe accrued 10 or more boards, fantasy owners probably won't complain too much about the lack of rebounds.

          Parker cleared 10 points for the first time in four games and did so in efficient fashion. After he went a combined 6-for-30 from the field over the previous three games, it's too early to pronounce that Parker has solved his shooting woes, but Thursday's performance at least offers some encouragement.

          The long-limbed Antetokounmpo used his impressive wingspan to rack up the defensive stats, a development that was nice to see after he had combined for just one steal and one block over the previous three contests. He's averaging a relatively modest 0.9 steals and 1.2 blocks on the season, but his growth as a scorer has made Antetokounmpo one of the league's top under-25 assets.

          Bayless was one of six Bucks players to reach double figures in the scoring column, as the team shot an outstanding 58.4 percent from the field on the evening. Since returning from an ankle injury earlier in the week, Bayless has averaged 13.7 points (on 61.7 percent shooting), four assists, and two rebounds over three games, but the continued strong play of starting point guard Michael Carter-Williams has forced Bayless to settle into a reserve role.

          Fresh off a career-high 36-point outing two days earlier in Oklahoma City, Middleton kept rolling again Thursday, and has now knocked down 15 three-pointers over his last three games.

          Excluding a 16-point outing against the lowly 76ers in which he shot 8-for-10 from the field, Parker has been abysmal in his last five contests. In those other four games, Parker has shot just 8-for-37 (21.6 percent) to fall below double digits in the scoring column in each game. Parker hasn't rebounded or defended well enough to atone for his decline in efficiency, and could be at risk of losing his starting job if his offensive struggles continue.

          Carter-Williams rebounded well from back-to-back eight-point outings, but even this solid performance may not be enough to prevent the point guard's minutes from plunging.

The drop in playing time resulted in a less productive stat line, but as he becomes further removed from the injury, it's possible that Bayless will settle into a regular 25-to-30-minute role.

It's not expected that Antetokounmpo's injury will sideline him for a significant amount of time, but because the Bucks' backcourt depth still remains thin with Greivis Vasquez (ankle) and Jerryd Bayless (ankle) both in the midst of lengthy absences, Mayo should continue to see ample minutes as the team's sixth man. However, in order to be as much of an asset as possible for fantasy owners, Mayo will need to show increased proficiency from three-point range.

Part of his extended playing time can be attributed to Greg Monroe dealing with foul trouble, but Henson certainly demonstrated during his run on the court why he's such a defensive asset.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/202328" class="ng-binding">Monroe (knee) will return to action, and start in Golden State Friday, Rusty Simmons of The San Francisco Chronicle reports.</a></strong><br><br>
          This is unexpected, yet welcomed, news for Monroe owners. He was originally expected to  miss at least a few more games, but will give it a go in Golden State Friday. It remains to be seen if he will play his normal workload, but expect Milwaukee to be somewhat cautious with their star big man if his knee appears to be hampering his play.

          This is somewhat surprising news, as Monroe was expected to miss at least a few more games. He has missed the Bucks previous two contests, and is probably on the more unlikely to play side of questionable, but this is still encouraging news. Expect an update prior to tip-off.

          Monroe is expected to miss 7-to-10 days, so it's very encouraging to see that he's already participating in portions of the Bucks' shootaround. If all goes well, he'll miss just the next few games, which should give Monroe the opportunity to return for a matchup with the 76ers on Dec. 23. Until he moves back into the lineup, look for John Henson and Miles Plumlee to soak up the extra minutes at center.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/202328" class="ng-binding">Monroe (knee) is expected to miss 7-to-10 days, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports.</a></strong><br><br>
          Monroe was a late scratch from Tuesday's loss to the Lakers, and he also sat out Wednesday's defeat at the hands of the Clippers due to a Grade 1 left MCL sprain. Both Monroe and the Bucks have downplayed the ailment, and while the team has not issued a timetable, Monroe is expected to miss around a week. Considering the injury occurred Tuesday morning, he figures to remain out Friday against Golden State, as well as Sunday against Phoenix, with the possibility that he could be back for a matchup with the 76ers on Dec. 23. In Monroe's absence, John Henson will continue to start at center, with Miles Plumlee serving as the backup.

          Middleton did well to fill up the stat sheet in multiple categories, but his ongoing shooting struggles continue to make the first season of his five-year, $70 million contract a disappointing one. Over his last 11 games, Middleton is sitting on a 37.4 percent shooting mark from the field.

          The Bucks brought Michael Carter-Williams back into the starting lineup, allowing Mayo to slide over to his more natural shooting guard spot. He responded with one of his better all-around showings of the season, as he matched his season-high in steals, and produced his second-best marks of the campaign in points, three-point buckets, assists. He'll continue to handle heavy minutes so long as both Jerryd Bayless (ankle) and Greivis Vasquez (ankle) are sidelined.

          Carter-Williams hopped back into the starting lineup after coming off the bench in the Bucks' previous 10 games, and continued his strong run of production, reaching the 17-point mark for the third game in a row. He saw his second-highest total of minutes on the season, and should continue to benefit from plenty of playing time while his shot keeps falling. During that three-game stretch, he's averaged 17.7 points, 5.7 assists, 4.7 boards, and 2.7 steals while shooting 52.2 percent from the field, well above his 40.5 percent career mark.

          After Henson started at center for the injured Greg Monroe (knee) in Tuesday's loss to the Lakers, coach Jason Kidd elected to turn over the starting gig to Miles Plumlee for the second half of the back-to-back set. Plumlee (22 minutes) ended up seeing comparable playing time to Henson, so regardless of who starts during Monroe's ongoing absence, it looks like the duo could see the minutes evenly distributed between them. Because of his superior shot-blocking and rebounding ability, Henson is probably the more appealing of the two players from a fantasy perspective, but unless he starts getting closer to 30 minutes, it'll be difficult for him to consistently produce helpful numbers.

          Plumlee actually saw two minutes fewer than he did while coming off the bench the previous night against the Lakers, and wasn't especially active during his time on the court. Still, Plumlee ended up seeing comparable playing time to fellow center John Henson (21 minutes), and although it's possible coach Jason Kidd could switch up the starting assignment in the Bucks' next game Friday in Golden State, expect the minutes to be fairly evenly distributed between the two players while Greg Monroe (knee) is out.
