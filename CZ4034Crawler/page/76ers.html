          Grant matched his career-high with 11 rebounds on Monday, and he earned 33 minutes off the bench in the 76ers' overtime loss to the Clippers. This was his third double-double of the season, and his fifth 15-plus point scoring performance of the campaign as well. If Grant develops a three-pointer, he will have a long career in this league. Nevertheless, he is still too inconsistent to rely on in most fantasy leagues despite the fact that he has seen 30 or more minutes 12 times in 2015-16.

          Okafor is now four games removed from a two-game absence due to the flu, but this was the first contest in which he's truly looked like himself. The 76ers have recently flipped positions with Okafor and Nerlens Noel, as the former now starts at power forward after serving as the club's center for much of his rookie season. The experiment will result in Okafor spending more time on the perimeter defending stretch fours, but as Saturday's outing showed, it won't necessarily result in fewer rebound opportunities.

          He may be still slightly hampered by an ankle ailment, but he played 23 minutes in Wednesday's game, and could see similar usage Saturday. That said, now that the Sixers are done with the experiment of occasionally using him at point guard, his value is limited to only the deepest of leagues.

          Grant was filling in for the injured Jahlil Okafor and got busy in a big way. He doesn't have much fantasy value while Okafor is in the lineup, but he certainly showed Wednesday that he does have the talent for significant minutes. Grant has an interesting situation because he's showed that he's worthy of minutes at times, but the Sixers need to play the guys that spent high draft picks on. When Robert Covington was out, it was Grant who filled in at small forward. Grant is quite versatile, but the problem is just finding the minutes for him while everyone is healthy.

Smith has one of the greatest things in fantasy sports working for him, opportunity. Being the Sixers' point guard doesn't offer much in the way of competition. Sure, T.J.

          Stauskas, who was making his second appearance following a three-game absence due to a shoulder contusion, started in place of the ailing JaKarr Sampson (illness), and also benefited from the early departure of Isaiah Canaan (ankle). Neither Sampson nor Canaan looks especially likely to play in Wednesday's game against the Pistons, which could again open up a healthy workload for Stauskas.

          Returning from a three-game absence, Stauskas was ineffective off the bench. In his seven prior appearances during the month of January, he averaged 8.1 points, 3.4 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 2.1 threes, 0.6 steals, and 0.4 assists in 28 minutes per game. The 22-year-old sophomore will likely have plenty of opportunities to succeed on a team lacking talent at shooting guard, but Stauskas has not posted back-to-back double-digit scoring games since he did it for five straight contests in the first two weeks of the season.

          Sampson left Wednesday's game against the Magic after just eight minutes because of a hip pointer. After another two days off for rest, Sampson's hip is feeling better and he's expected to take the court on Saturday versus the Celtics. With Nik Stauskas set to remain out with a shoulder injury, Sampson could move back into the starting lineup. He's been rotating in out as a starter all season, so we'll have to wait for coach Brett Brown to make the final decision, which will likely come sometime close to tip-off on Saturday.

He was listed as probable going into Wednesday's outing, but ultimately was held out. Despite optimism that he was nearing a return, Stauskas has now been listed as doubtful in advance of Saturday's tilt with the Celtics as well.

          In his second game back from a calf injury, Grant was nearly able to double up his minutes total from the previous contest (15). He benefited from Nerlens Noel's second-half absence due to a headache, but Grant may have earned his court time anyway due to the shot-blocking prowess he demonstrated. He's logged five rejections in three different contests this season and is averaging 1.6 blocks over only 25.6 minutes per game this season.

He's not a total slouch in the other categories, either, with averages of 5.7 points, 2.2 rebounds, 1.6 steals, and a 46 percent shooting mark during that same span, so there still might be a place for McConnell in very deep leagues.

          Although coach Brett Brown was initially counting on Marshall to claim the starting role at point guard upon returning from a torn ACL in December, the 24-year-old's ineffectiveness ultimately led the team to trade for Ish Smith, who has been a godsend since arriving from New Orleans. Since Smith's acquisition, Marshall has also been passed up on the depth chart by T.J. McConnell, who has excelled in a backup capacity, leaving no minutes available for Marshall. As a result, Marshall, who hasn't played in five of the team's last six games, will likely require a Smith or McConnell injury before reclaiming a rotation spot.

          Coach Brett Brown said that Grant was going to be held to a 20-minute restriction Monday after the calf injury prevented him from playing in the previous two games, but the second-year forward couldn't even reach that mark after collecting five fouls in 15 minutes. Grant's limitations allowed Robert Covington to enter the starting five and play 46 minutes, but once Grant becomes healthier, there's a decent possibility he'll reclaim his role as the Sixers' starting small forward.

          Covington drew back into the starting five for the first time since Dec. 26 and was entrusted to stay on the court for nearly the entire contest, as Jerami Grant (calf) was limited to just 15 minutes in his return from an injury. With point guard Ish Smith (28 shot attempts) and Jahlil Okafor (17 attempts) dominating the Sixers' possessions, Covington didn't get much of an opportunity to look for his own offense, but continued to sparkle from three-point range. Over his last three games, he's knocked down 13-of-27 tries from beyond the arc.

The third-year player has now collected 30 points on 9-for-18 shooting over the last two games, including a 5-of-10 mark from three-point range. Canaan's recent success could allow him to remain in the rotation even once Stauskas returns.

          While JaKarr Sampson will draw the start in place of Grant, coach Brett Brown told the media pregame that he expects Covington to see an expanded role. The Tennessee State product has struggled of late, averaging just 5.5 points on 38.7 percent shooting over his last six games (16.8 minutes per game), but he's a volume three-point shooter capable of heating up without notice, so he may be worth a look in daily contests.

As soon as Grant is healthy, there's a good chance Sampson is moved back to the bench, although the two have been rotating on and off all season.

          After announcing his retirement in August, Brand is set to sign on with his former team. The 36-year-old played for the 76ers for four season from 2008-12. Last season he appeared in 36 games for the Atlanta Hawks, averaging 2.7 points, 2.8 rebounds, 0.7 blocks, 0.6 assists, and 0.5 steals in 14 minutes per game. The first-overall pick in the 1999 NBA Draft never quite lived up to the hype, mostly due to a number of injuries throughout his 16-year career. The 76ers are likely bringing Brand in to provide bench depth, as well as serve in a mentorship role for Philly's young big men, Jahlil Okafor and Nerlens Noel. As such, he's highly unlikely to make a fantasy impact in almost any format this season.

          Okafor, who's sat out the last two contests with knee soreness, was initially deemed a game-time call after missing practice Tuesday. It looks as though he's been given the green light by the team's medical staff return, but it will be in a bench capacity, and it's possible his minutes could be limited due to the knee issue.

          Grant was dropped from the starting lineup in favor of Carl Landry, with neither player acquitting themselves well.

The 32-year-old actually exceeded his restriction in Saturday's win over the Suns by playing 23 minutes, so the 20-minute limit seems to be pretty soft.

          The 32-year-old received a nice chunk of playing time in only his second game back from off-season wrist surgery, in part due to the musical chairs in the frontcourt brought about by Jahlil Okafor's absence due to a knee injury.

          Smith was a DFS punt-play darling earlier this season due to his efficient production when he started in place of Jrue Holiday for one half of back-to-back sets, but with Holiday's restrictions now nearly behind him and Tyreke Evans and Norris Cole since returning to full health at the beginning of December, Smith had seen his playing time fall by the wayside in New Orleans. However, the move to the 76ers -- with whom he played for part of the 2014-15 campaign -- should make Smith a worthy pickup in deeper leagues, as he faces a less difficult climb to the top of the depth chart in his new locale. The trio of Kendall Marshall, who recently returned from an ACL tear, T.J. McConnell, or Isaiah Canaan have shown little more than occasional flashes of competence as starting point guards for the 76ers this season, and the subsequent release of Tony Wroten to make room for Smith would seem to suggest the team is willing to experiment with new options at the position. Smith was averaging 13.9 points (on 43 percent shooting), nine assists, 5.4 rebounds, and 1.4 steals per 36 minutes with the Pelicans, so he could hold plenty of appeal if he ends up landing the starting role in Philadelphia.

Over that same span of games, he's supplied only four rebounds, four assists, four steals, and one block.

          Covington looked like a fantasy monster near the end of November when he was knocking down three-pointers and raking in steals at prolific rates, but he's slowed down considerably on both fronts in December. He's averaging only one steal across 12 contests this month, and is shooting only 31.5 percent from three-point range. The ongoing struggles have his playing time on the decline, as Covington has fallen below 30 minutes in five consecutive games.

          Thompson's hot shooting allowed him to take away some court time from starting small forward Robert Covington, and that trend could persist Wednesday against Milwaukee. Covington's three-point production has taken a dramatic step back in December, while Thompson has been heating up from deep of late, knocking down 10 of his 21 three-point attempts across the last five games.

          Stauskas has been a ghost on the court lately, as Tuesday's game marked the first time in four contests that he'd even attempted a shot from the field. With goose eggs in the scoring column in all four of those games and his playing time seemingly on the decline, there's few formats where Stauskas is worth a roster spot.

          Grant received the same amount of playing time as the man he replaced in the starting lineup at power forward, Nerlens Noel. It's likely that Grant's entry into the top unit was just a matchup-based decision to counter the Grizzlies' small-ball lineup, so expect Grant to head back to the bench Wednesday, with  the Sixers facing the Bucks' more sizable frontcourt.

          Both Wroten and Kendall Marshall continue to sit out one half of back-to-back sets following their recent returns from ACL tears, and after Marshall rested in Tuesday's loss to the Grizzlies, it'll be Wroten's turn to take the day off Wednesday. Wroten reportedly entered Tuesday's game with a 25-minute restriction, but he ended up starting and played a season-high 29 minutes. He wasn't able to deliver much impressive production with the added playing time, however, finishing with only seven points (2-9 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 3-8 FT), seven assists, five rebounds, and five turnovers. In his first eight games back from the injury, Wroten is shooting just 33.8 percent from the field and is averaging 3.6 turnovers and 2.5 assists in only 18 minutes per contest, numbers that won't help his case in eventually claiming the top spot on the depth chart at point guard.

Well, he didn't exactly rebound nicely Tuesday, failing to reach double-digit boards for the fifth straight game. Okafor will continue to do what he's good at, score down low, but right now that's about all he can be relied on for.

          Wroten will get the start with Kendall Marshall (rest) being held out of the first half of a back-to-back set. Both Marshall and Wroten made their season debuts earlier in December following 11-month rehab processes from torn ACL, and for the time being, it sounds like both will receive alternate rest days during back-to-back scenarios, meaning that Wroten will be held out of Wednesday's tilt with the Bucks. That being said, Wroten does seem to be nearing the end of his restriction period, as he was previously limited to 20 minutes per game, but will see his playing time increase Tuesday.
