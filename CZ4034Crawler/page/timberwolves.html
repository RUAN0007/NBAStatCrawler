          Coming out of the All-Star break, Wolves coach Sam Mitchell said he plans to rotation LaVine and veteran Tayshaun Prince as starters, and it looks like he'll lean toward LaVine on Monday after starting Prince in Saturday's loss to the Knicks. While Prince has seen more of a reduced role, LaVine's minutes haven't been drastically impacted by whether or not he's starting, and he's averaging nearly 32 minutes per game in seven February contests.

          Martin returned to practice on Wednesday after dealing with a sore wrist prior to the All-Star break. It comes as no surprise then that the Timberwolves expect Martin to be available to play Friday. Despite the fact that he's healthy, it appears Martin has fallen out of the Wolves' regular rotation and could struggle to field meaningful minutes. He's notched 16 minutes or less in each of his last four games.

          LaVine is getting into the starting lineup due to Tayshaun Prince (personal) missing the game. LaVine has been averaging 31.3 minutes per game this month, and could be in for even more than that now that he's in the starting lineup.

Leading up to Tuesday's game against the Lakers, Martin was considered doubtful, then questionable, then doubtful again, before ultimately being ruled out. With that situation in mind, Martin's status could end up coming down to a game-time decision. Should Martin be ruled out, Zach Lavine, who played 26 minutes off the bench Tuesday, would stand to see an increased role.

          Sunday would mark Martin's fourth consecutive missed game due to a wrist injury if he is ultimately unable to play. Zach LaVine has demonstrated excellent scoring ability off the bench as the Timberwolves' primary reserve guard in the last three games with Martin sideline and will likley continue to do so if Martin is ruled out yet again.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/708" class="ng-binding">Garnett is questionable for Monday's game against the Cavaliers due to a sore right knee, Jerry Zgoda of the Star Tribune reports.</a></strong><br><br>
          Garnett played just nine minutes during Saturday's win over the Grizzlies and failed to play at all in the second half. He's still dealing with some soreness in his knee and is now listed as questionable for Monday's outing versus the Cavaliers. It wouldn't be surprising to see the veteran receive the night off, which would likely open up extra minutes for both Gorgui Dieng and Nemanja Bjelica. Garnett's status should be updated again early Monday morning.

Pekovic rested on Tuesday night versus the Pelicans, but he is slowly being worked back into the flow of things after missing the first few months of the season.

          Muhammad played the second most minutes on his team next to Andrew Wiggins, Muhammad continues to earn quality playing time lately, and he is responding with solid play--posting 15.0 points (45.5 FG, 38.5 3Pt, 76.9 FT) 3.4 rebounds, 1.2 assists, and 0.2 steals in 28 minutes per night over the last five games. Had he not put up a two-point effort in Wednesday's loss versus the Rockets, his recent scoring numbers would be even more impressive. Nevertheless, coach Sam Mitchell has made Muhammad a key part of the rotation, and he is not disappointing.

The recent return of Nikola Pekovic will likely eat away at a few more of Garnett's precious minuets, and even if K.G. continues to start games, the 39-year-old forward is essentially a player-coach at this point in his career.

If Martin were to start earning closer to the 25 minutes per game he was through the first three months, he might have some value in deeper leagues.

          Pekovic, who made his season debut Wednesday after suffering an Achilles injury in March 2015, was only recently cleared for full-contact practices. With Karl-Anthony Towns and Gorgui Dieng assuming the lion's share of minutes at the five, it seems unlikely that Pekovic will play a large role in the team's rotation this season. Expect coach Sam Mitchell to limit Pekovic's playing time as the 29-year-old continues to recuperate from his injury.

          Martin has been a healthy scratch in the past seven games, but will return to the court on Wednesday night. The Timberwolves have been opting to give their younger players more game-experience instead of playing the 32-year-old Martin. There is no word on how much he will play, but will likely contend with Zach LaVine and Tyus Jones for minutes off the bench.

          Pekovic will make his season debut Wednesday night after going down with a ankle/Achilles injury in March 2015, which required surgery that he has been recovery from ever since. Expect his minutes to be heavily monitored to under 20 minutes on Wednesday night. He was just cleared for full-contact practices a little over a week ago, so the Timberwolves don't want to put too much on his plate too quickly. He will compete with Gorgui Dieng, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Kevin Garnett for minutes as he continues his road to a full recovery.

          Pekovic was cleared for full contact practices about a week ago, so he's had time to get back into the swing of things. Coach Sam Mitchel said Pekovic has a "50-50" chance of playing, but we'll likely have to wait till Wednesday morning's shootaround before seeing his status updated. If he does play, he'll likely be on a minutes restriction, although nothing has been reported indicating that as of now. Even when fully healthy, he could have trouble battling for minutes with the likes of Kevin Garnett and Karl Anthony-Towns.

          It's the most points that Prince has scored in four games, which illustrates just how infrequently he's involved in the T-Wolves' offense.

          Dieng continues to come off the bench behind Kevin Garnett, but he's still the Timberwolves' second-best big man after rookie Karl-Anthony Towns, and thus regularly outpaces Garnett for minutes. Though Dieng has been over double figures in the scoring column in only two of the last six games, his activity on the defensive end often compensates for his lack of point production.

          Towns has now been held under 10 points in two straight contests, but on a positive note, he was at least able to knock down half his shots after a dreadful 4-for-17 showing from the field in the Timberwolves' previous game Saturday versus Milwaukee. While it's disappointing he wasn't able to carve up a miserable Philly frontcourt, Towns' strong December averages of 18.6 points, 9.5 boards, and 1.6 blocks should provide a better picture of what to expect from the rookie the rest of the way.

          Rubio is shooting just 31.3 percent from the field over his past five games, a mark that's awful even by his low standards.

          The 25 minutes was his lowest amount of playing time since Nov. 2 as Wiggins has failed to reach 20 points in six of his past seven games. His shooting percentages are down and he continues to be a very one-dimensional fantasy option, making his value in daily formats hard to find.

          That makes three straight games in double figures for Muhammad, who keeps gaining more and more confidence in his shot game after game. The 34 minutes was also a season high, though Muhammad has seen plenty of playing time throughout the season, but has all of a sudden started to turn it into something for fantasy owners.
