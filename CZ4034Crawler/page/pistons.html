          Harper has been playing in the D-League with the Los Angeles D-Fenders after being waived by the Nets back in late-October of 2015. The 26-year-old will look to make his first appearance for an NBA squad since the 2011-12 season where he had 14 outings with the Magic. Although, Harper should have a tough time finding rotational minutes in Detroit, even if he's ultimately given another 10-day contract or signed for the remainder of the season.

He took less low percentage shots and it actually translated to more offense. If Caldwell-Pope can continue to keep things simple, he should have more games that look like this as the Pistons fight for a playoff spot.

Regardless, Bullock is generally not a part of the Pistons' rotation, averaging just 4.9 minutes per game, so his return doesn't have much of a fantasy impact.

          Baynes was a true game-time decision Friday, having missed shootaround and some practice time due to an illness. However, the reserve big was able to play his usual allotment of minutes. He knocked down all three of his attempts from the floor and rebounded at a high rate, pulling in six rebounds in just 14 minutes. The Pistons are off Saturday before returning to action Sunday against the Pelicans.

          Tolliver, who started the Pistons' final game before the All-Star break while Ersan Ilyasova sat out with an illness, now figures to hold on to that role after Ilyasova was traded along with Brandon Jennings to the Magic on Tuesday. The Pistons did acquire a promising young talent in Tobias Harris in exchange for those two players, but coach Stan Van Gundy suggested he'd bring Harris off the bench for the team's first three games out of the break as a means of igniting a moribund second unit. It's expected that Harris, who signed a four-year, $64 million contract this past summer, will eventually settle into the starting role he occupied in Orlando, and even while coming off the bench, he still figures to receive more minutes than Tolliver. While Tolliver should still benefit from more court time than the 20 minutes he's averaging on the season, he'll often rank as the fifth offensive option on the court when he plays with the starters, meaning a dramatic rise in his point production shouldn't be expected.

Still, the five blocks he recorded matched his season-high, he now has 12 games with three steals or more, and he has 45 double-doubles as well. The 22-year-old center will appear in his first All-Star game this weekend, and the Pistons are off until Feb. 19's matchup with the Wizards.

          Drummond lost some minutes due to foul trouble and free-throw woes, but he was beneficial in the time he did spend on the court. He also had a nasty fall on his side after being fouled on a dunk attempt, but that didn't appear to be a reason for fewer minutes. More teams are starting to deploy the "Hack-a-Drummond" and that could hurt his fantasy value somewhat. Drummond is shooting 35% from the free-throw line and his fantasy owners will want to see that number improve so he's on the court down the stretch in close games. Next game, the Pistons take on the Pacers where Drummond should have another plentiful stat line.

          Jackson struggled for most of the game but picked it up late in Thursday's win against the Knicks. The young point guard nailed two three-pointers late in the fourth quarter, which basically saved his night from being a total bust. Jackson had a seemingly favorable matchup at the beginning of the night against Jose Calderon, but Langston Galloway ended up getting the bulk of the minutes and that limited his production. The Pistons next game is against the Pacers, where Jackson has a great matchup against George Hill.

          Johnson hit a career-high for points and also matched his highest assist total on Thursday.

There was some chatter that the Pistons might lose a step without KCP and the number of minutes he logs each game, but Johnson did more than what was expected of him.

          Drummond was the bee's knees for his team on Wednesday, while the rest of the Pistons struggled. His 13 rebounds were six more than any other starter and it really was a one-man show, headlined by the former UConn grad. Drummond had a great matchup on Wednesday against the Celtics, but the sledding gets a little tougher on Friday against the Knicks. Drummond is still a must-start in season-long formats, but he is a liability at the free-throw line more often than not. Proceed with caution when deploying Drummond in the daily game.

          Johnson scored in double digits for the third time in the last four games--the second time he has done that this season. The rookie has been enjoying a consistent, albeit reasonable role off the bench, and despite the loss this was likely a huge confidence booster for the 19-year-old wing.

          Ilyasova had a rough night even though the rest of his teammates helped out in getting the win. Prior to tonight, Ilyasova was having his best month of the season, scoring 12.6 points. We can chalk this one up to an off-night for him, and expect that he'll come back strong in the near future. Ilyasova is a sneaky play in both season-long leagues and the daily fantasy game when in a favorable matchup.

He typically doesn't get 32 minutes each game, but with Irsan Ilyasova struggling and the defensively-inept Sixers in town, Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy elected to take a chance and go with the rookie. Johnson doesn't have much fantasy appeal at the moment, but should one of the Pistons in the starting lineup go down, then his value would skyrocket.

          Drummond avoided the major free throw woes en route to yet another amazing output. Since the game against Houston on Jan.20 where he was 13-for-36 from the charity stripe, Drummond had been a combined 4-for-19 in the three games leading up to this one. It's good to see he can actually hit free throws once again because he was starting to lose minutes via the "Hack-a-Drummond." The matchup against Philly must have gotten him in better spirits, but it may be short-lived because Drummond has a very tough matchup against Cleveland on Friday.

          Jackson has gone the route of scoring rather than dishing these last two games, as he's scored a combined 56 points in that span. The assist numbers have taken a hit, but they will return soon. Jackson has the highest pick-and-roll percentage (56.3%) in the NBA among starting point guards so he is bound to be in the thick of whichever type of offensive set is working for Detroit. These last two matchups have just allowed him to score more and we should see more of that against Cleveland on Friday.

          Jackson's 12-of-19 showing from the field broke a five-game streak in which he shot less than 50 percent in each contest. He has cut his turnovers to under two per game in January, and despite Monday's four-assist performance, R-Jax has raised his assist average every month while committing fewer turnovers every month as well.

Baynes has begun receiving a higher allotment of minutes in January, including a season-high 30 on Saturday, and has been productive with the extended opportunity.

Drummond certainly lived up to his reputation, as his 23 missed free throws set an NBA single-game record, while his 36 attempts set a franchise record. The Pistons attempted to work around the Rockets' strategy by playing Drummond for only 23 minutes, and it appeared to work, as the team was able to crank out a nine-point win. Drummond is now shooting a woeful 35.5 percent from the line on the season, and because he's upped his attempts while becoming more of a focal point in the Pistons' offense in 2015-16, he's hurting fantasy owners even more in the free-throw percentage category compared to previous seasons.

Over the five most recent games, he is delivering 14.4 points, 5.6 rebounds, three assists, 0.6 blocks, and 0.4 steals in 37 minutes per night.

          Bullock hadn't seen the floor in the Pistons' last three games, and hasn't scored a field goal since Nov. 15. If he isn't going to see any use at the NBA level, then he might as well go down a level and try to develop into something the Pistons can use.

          Hilliard had seen some use in early December, but hasn't registered a minute in Detroit's last three games. He'll head down to Grand Rapids, where he figures to at least help Brandon Jennings (Achilles) with his rehab while seeing more use.

          Drummond fouled out along with teammates Marcus Morris and Stanley Johnson, but Drummond now has four 20-20 games, and he has failed to record a double-double in only two of the Pistons' 28 games thus far. Regardless of his abysmal free-throw shooting, Drummond is one of the top fantasy players in all fantasy formats, and he is making a strong case to start in the All-Star game.

          Jackson committed only two turnovers in 50 minutes, and this was his second 30-10 showing of the season. R-Jax has four double-doubles on the year now, and he and Andre Drummond continue to be among the best two-man duos in fantasy.

          Morris fouled out along with Andre Drummond and Stanley Johnson, but filled up the stat-sheet before exiting Friday's much-needed marathon win. Expect Morris to continue producing serviceable numbers so long as he remains among the league leaders in minutes per game.

          Jennings remains on track to make his season debut on Dec. 29 against New York, and as part of his rehab effort he'll play for the Drive as they take on the Iowa Energy on Saturday night. It's possible Jennings could make multiple appearances in Grand Rapids, but obviously he'll only remain with the team on a rehab basis.

          As has been the case throughout his career, Jackson punished his opposition with sharp free-throw shooting. Having now scored at least 20 points in each of his last four games, Jackson's impressive scoring overshadows his abnormally high turnover rate.

          Known primarily for his defensive prowess, Caldwell-Pope's offensive game has been coming to life lately -- averaging 20.3 points over his last four games. Perhaps most impressive about Caldwell-Pope's performance Wednesday was his accuracy from the field. The 22-year-old entered Wednesday with a 39.8 field goal percentage. Friday will be a good test for Caldwell-Pope, when Detroit will take on the red-hot Bulls.

          Drummond's rare three-pointer came on a half-court shot to end the first half -- a shot Drummond acknowledges he practices all the time. Returning to form in the second half, Drummond would record his 16th double-double of the season. The 22-year-old remains an elite rebounding asset.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/201943" class="ng-binding">Jennings is planning to return to game action Dec. 29 against the Knicks, Vincent Goodwill of CSN Chicago reports.</a></strong><br><br>
          This news comes after a report Wednesday morning indicating Jennings could play with the Pistons' D-League affiliate at Grand Rapids this coming weekend. Whether that happens or not, Jennings appears to be roughly two weeks away from making his season debut after an Achilles tear put an end to his 2014-15 campaign. Jennings figures to come off the bench with Reggie Jackson firmly entrenched as Detroit's starting point guard, though coach Stan Van Gundy did indicate during the offseason that he may consider playing Jennings and Jackson together, at times. Regardless, given the Pistons' decision to extend Jackson this summer, Jennings, and his team-friendly $8 million expiring deal, would appear to be one of the leagues top trade candidates.
