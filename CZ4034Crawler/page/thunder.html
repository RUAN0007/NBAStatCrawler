          Roberson was active for Sunday's contest for the first time since hurting his knee back on Jan. 24 against the Nets, but because of his lack of recent practice time, coach Billy Donovan didn't feel comfortable calling the 24-year-old's number. The Thunder continued to start Dion Waiters at shooting guard Sunday, but if Roberson successfully completes Tuesday's practice without incident, he could reclaim starting duties as soon as Wednesday.

          While Sunday's line was excellent, the perennial All-Star has been playing so well of late that these types of performances have become par for the course.

The Villanova product was averaging just under 20 minutes per game in Denver and he figures to see a similar, but likely reduced, role off the bench for the Thunder.

          The 23-year-old has rattled off seven consecutive double-digit scoring performances heading into the All-Star break, and also posted two double-doubles in the last three games. Coach Billy Donovan has opted to keep Kanter in a mid-to-high-usage bench role this season, with the five-year veteran and starter Steven Adams splitting the time virtually down the middle on most nights. This appears to suit Kanter well, as he lacks Adams' defensive prowess but offers more on offense, making him an effective complement and providing the Thunder's second unit with a bit more scoring punch. Kanter heads into the All-Star break with averages of 11.9 points and 7.7 rebounds over 20.8 minutes per game so far this season.

          Like fellow superstar Russell Westbrook, Durant got a bit of a break on Thursday in the blowout victory. His 30 minutes on the court were the fewest he'd played since Jan. 15 against the Timberwolves, as was his point total. The All-Star nevertheless drained multiple threes for the sixth straight contest, and is already averaging an impressive 34.3 points in five February games.

          The seven-year veteran impressively bounced back from three straight single-digit outings with a strong performance against Anthony Davis. Although he still provides plenty of his trademark defense, Ibaka's scoring and rebounding have both dropped this season as compared to his numbers in those categories over the prior three campaigns. Despite the slight dips, the veteran is realistically only a distant third scoring option on a team where the top two playmakers generate an inordinate amount of offensive production. His ability to provide solid numbers across the stat sheet and the occasional double-digit scoring effort still render him a valuable mid-tier commodity in all fantasy formats.

          The 27-year-old is one of the few players who can tally a near triple-double on relative cruise control, which is exactly what Westbrook accomplished Thursday. He played his lowest amount of minutes since Jan. 15 against the Mavericks, yet racked up a stat line befitting of a much larger allotment of playing time. Westbrook heads into the All-Star break hot, having tallied multiple three-pointers in three straight games for the first time since mid-November, and averaging 24.3 points, 11.3 assists, 10.8 rebounds and 2.0 steals over the Thunder's first five games in February.

          It was just another day at the office for Durant, whose Thunder have off until Thursday's matchup with  a Pelicans team that played Monday and also has another game on Tuesday.

          Westbrook gave the ball away six times, but he was rather efficient otherwise thanks to the fact that he earned 12 free-throw attempts. It's pretty crazy, but Monday basically counts as an off night for the man who leads the league in double-doubles. Looking ahead to Thursday's matchup with the Pelicans, opposing guard Jrue Holiday has given Westbrook some trouble in the past, but Holiday comes off the bench, so Westbrook will likely spend plenty of time facing off against subpar individual defenders--which is a recipe for disaster in New Orleans.

          Payne suffered a concussion in Wednesday night's win over the Timberwolves. The rookie point guard will need to pass a baseline test that is part of standard concussion protocol procedure before returning to the court. Payne could miss a handful of games depending on the severity of the concussion. In his absence look for D.J. Augustin to inherit most of the reserve point guard minutes.

          Westbrook had five turnovers, but as usual, his positives far outweighed his negatives. He has six 30 point-10 assist performances this season, and Westbrook has been a beast overall despite struggling from the field lately.

Adams was wearing a brace to help stabilize his right elbow at shootaround, but his shot looked fluid during the session, according to Slater. If Adams continues to feel comfortable following pregame warmups, he'd likely take back his usual starting post, resulting in reductions in playing time for Enes Kanter and Nick Collison.

          The Thunder are going to give their big man's elbow time to heal, which should allow him to avoid a nagging injury. If he indeed does miss the remainder of the road trip, that will result in two more games missed following Sunday's matchup in Brooklyn.

          It's the third time in seven games that Westbrook has registered exactly 15 assists, and he's cleared 10 assists in three of those other four games.

Kanter clearly has the ability to offer outstanding production from the center position, but continues to receive modest playing time while coming off the bench behind Steven Adams. While not particularly proficient on the defensive end, the 23-year-old can nevertheless deliver some solid rebounding numbers to go along with his above-average scoring.

          Durant said he sustained the injury during the second quarter of Saturday's blowout win over the Hornets. He played through the sprain in the second half, finishing with 29 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks in 35 minutes. Durant is unlikely to miss considerable time, and his first chance to return will come Wednesday when the Thunder play host to Memphis. In his place Monday, the likes of Kyle Singler, Enes Kanter and Anthony Morrow could each pick up some extra run.

His minutes are also largely consistent, as coach Billy Donovan appears intent on bringing the more offensively proficient but defensively inferior Enes Kanter off the bench.

          The perennial All-Star was dominating throughout the contest, and had a particularly memorable first half. Westbrook collected 21 points on 8-for-9 shooting over the first two quarters, and also tallied eight assists over that span. It was the second time in the last three contests that Westbrook dished out 12 dimes and also shot over 60 percent from the field. He's also been outstanding on the defensive end in recent games, amassing 17 steals over the last four contests.

          While he played second fiddle to Russell Westbrook on Thursday, Durant still ended up as the Thunder's second-leading scorer on the night and the only other one besides Westbrook to break the 20-point mark. The perennial All-Star is a virtual lock for 20-plus points and solid rebound and assist totals each time he takes the court. He's also notably drained at least one three-pointer in every game that he's been active for this season, and multiple treys in 20 of those contests.

          After getting off to a slow start during December, Kanter is trending back up again, as he's popped for at least 14 points in five of his last six games, and has cleared the 20-point threshold in back-to-back outings. While the scoring surge hasn't resulted in much of an uptick in playing time, Kanter's averages of 16.2 points and 9.5 boards across 22.2 minutes during that six-game span are certainly strong enough to make him an attractive, relatively inexpensive DFS option most nights.

          Things appeared to be trending in this direction for a while, as Augustin had seen 14 minutes or fewer in the preceding four games, despite averaging 15.7 minutes on the season. With a season field-goal percentage of just 37.9 percent, Augustin has largely failed to provide the second unit with the sort of spark the Thunder were expecting, prompting coach Billy Donovan to move rookie Cameron Payne into the rotation. Payne capitalized on the opportunity by scoring 16 points (on 5-of-6 shooting) in only 16 minutes, and should continue to rank ahead of Augustin on the depth chart until further notice.

          Payne has inherited playing time from the struggling D.J.

Considering that he shares time at center with starter Steven Adams, these are admirable numbers of late for Kanter.

Breaking news: Russell Westbrook is good at the basketballing. He'll get a couple of days to savor the win before the Thunder host the Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

The perennial All-Star has enjoyed perfect health so far this season, and is averaging 26.2 points, 9.9 assists and 7.3 rebounds a night over 22 games.

          Ibaka managed his third consecutive double-digit scoring performance, and eighth in his last nine games. His shot has also been particularly proficient over the last three games, during which the seven-year pro has shot 62 percent (23-for-31), and has added 21 boards. Ibaka has once again served as a reliable third scoring option for the Thunder, and his offensive presence becomes even more prominent when Kevin Durant is forced to miss any time.

          It was the Thunder superstar's first triple-double of the season, which partially consisted of a season-high 10 assists. It also marked Durant's third straight game with at least a double-double performance in points and rebounds. Ever since returning from a six-game absence in mid-to-late November due to a hamstring injury, the nine-year pro's shot has been particularly sharp, with Durant posting a 56.3 field goal percentage over eight outings.

Over his last five games, the power forward is shooting 57.9% from the field and averaging 13.8 PPG.  He also had at least three blocks in three of those games.

          Kanter wasn't as productive Tuesday as other games he's played this season, and it was also the fewest minutes he's played since November 25.  Despite this, he still is playing comparable minutes to starter Steven Adams, and even played one more than Adams on Tuesday night.

          Durant caught fire early and helped the Thunder put out the Grizzlies in colorful fashion. He's now logged his fifth game this season shooting above 60 percent from the field, and his sixth game going perfect from the line (with at least four attempts).

          Westbrook had quite an unusual game on Tuesday, and much of that was because of the fact that Durant caught fire early and the Thunder put out the Grizzlies for good in the third quarter.

          Durant carried the team in the first half, but moved out of Russell Westbrook's way down the stretch. Still, the all-star forward was able to post a pretty nice line. He's been very hot from downtown, shooting 51.9 percent (14-27) in his past four games. Durant's numbers have been excellent, though his bodies ability to stay healthy remains a concern.

          The route from the NBA club to the D-League has become a familiar one for Huestis at this point. Huestis has yet to appear in an NBA game this season and won't crack coach Billy Donovan's rotation unless a number of injuries compromise the Thunder's depth.

          McGary has seen five combined minutes over the Thunder's last nine games, and given that he's only 23 years old, it makes sense for the organization to send him to the D-League for some more extensive playing time. He'll likely rejoin the Thunder after a few games with the D-League affiliate, but he may need an injury or two to hit the frontcourt before he starts seeing minutes in the NBA with regularity.

          Russell Westbrook was having a rare off-night, so Durant picked up the slack without the Thunder missing a beat. Durant's now averaging 30.3 points, 8.3 boards, 4.0 threes, 3.7 assists, 2.3 blocks and 1.3 steals in three games since missing six starts due to a hamstring injury, and it seems safe to say that he's fully healthy.

          He also chipped in four boards, four assists and a steal, but overall it was the worst game of the season for the normally devastating Westbrook, who's only failed to score 20 or more points twice in 17 games. Barring the announcement of an illness or injury to explain the poor performance, expect him to bounce back Monday against the Hawks.

          Waiters returned to the bench last game with the return of Kevin Durant, but has now posted 12 and 16 points over the last two contests. He still appears to be poised for 25-28 minutes per night, and he's going to take his share of shots, so in spite of a possible dip in production, Waiters may still be in line to score 10-plus points a night, with occasional outbursts in steals moving forward.

          Westbrook has been on a tear over the past five games, averaging 31.0 points, 6.8 rebounds, 9.6 assists, and 3.2 steals during that span. The return of Kevin Durant doesn't appear to be preventing Westbrook from posting elite numbers, as evidenced by his uber-efficient 15-for-26 shooting from the field and 17-for-18 showing at the line over the past two games. It is noteworthy that he's attempting fewer field goals, but owners can't complain when he's capitalizing on almost every category night in and night out.

          McGary suffered an ankle injury in Monday's win over Utah, but it looks to be nothing serious as he was moving well at shootaround. The big man should be available Wednesday night, though he's played sparingly this season, appearing in only five games.

          With Kevin Durant (hamstring) back from injury, the Thunder didn't have much of a need to keep Huestis around as an emergency option on the wing. Huestis will head back to the D-League to hone his game and faces an uphill battle in his quest to become a rotation player for the Thunder.

          Despite the move back to the bench, Waiters played almost identical minutes to the previous two games where he started.  He also amassed more assists and steals Monday than in the his two starts combined.  Even with the return of Kevin Durant, Waiter will probably continue to get plenty of opportunities to score off the bench.
