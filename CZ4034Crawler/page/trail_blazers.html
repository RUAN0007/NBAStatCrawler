          He's arguably the hottest player in the NBA right now, pouring in 30 or more points in four straight games and leading the Blazers to a 10-1 record since late January. Lillard's assists have drooped a bit during his hot streak, but it's hard to justify passing it off when you're shooting 45.8 percent (22-for-48) from three-point range. With C.J. McCollum beginning to heat up as well, though, Lillard could start pulling in double-doubles once again.

          He and Damian Lillard have been all but unstoppable from beyond the arc lately, and McCollum is shooting 60 percent (9-for-15) on three-pointers over the last three games. The backcourt duo has led Portland to a 10-1 record since late January, pushing them up to a surprising seventh in the Western Conference despite the offseason departures of LaMarcus Aldridge and Nic Batum. McCollum's 20.9 points per game is more than triple what he managed off the bench last season, and he's all but a shoo-in at this point for the league's Most Improved Player Award.

          Leonard logged at least 11 minutes per game, when healthy, in the first half of the season, but his role has diminished considerably in the initial two contests following the break. In fact, he's earned just 12 minutes total, which has coincided with a healthy Noah Vonleh and a consistent role for Maurice Harkless. Because the Blazers' health is intact, coach Terry Stotts may be tinkering with the lineup with the postseason in mind, but the current five-game winning streak is likely guiding his current rotations. If the past two contests is any indication, a new status quo could be emerging, leaving Leonard as the odd man out.

          Plumlee fell just shy of his 14th double-double of the season, but two plays, one savvy and the other hustle, in the final 30 seconds defined his night. Gaining possession of the ball at the top of the key when Damian Lillard was bottled up, Plumlee waited patiently for the dynamic guard to shake his defender, and the go-ahead layup from Lillard ensued. On the Blazers' next defensive possession, Plumlee was unable to grab a rebound, but his presence of mind to throw the ball off Derrick Favors spurred a series of CJ McCollum free throws that put the game away. Plumlee's workload (26 minutes per game) still isn't amenable to a number of formats, but he holds the ability to stuff the stat sheet in any given night.

          Harkless' minutes waned in the latter half of January, with two DNPs and three other outings with fewer than 10 minutes during a six-game stretch. At the time, coach Terry Stotts cited getting Gerald Henderson more run on the wing, but an ankle injury to Noah Vonleh on Feb. 6 thrust Harkless from little-used forward to starter for three games before the break. Harkless has used the opportunity to record double-digit points in five consecutive contests en route to averages of 14.4 points (on 63 percent shooting), 7.2 rebounds, 1.4 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.2 three-pointers in 26 minutes per game. The outburst has pushed Meyers Leonard to the wayside -- less than 13 minutes per game during that run -- meaning Stotts may just be riding the hot hand, but Harkless is certainly deserving of a look at the moment due to his jam-packed lines.

          Vonleh ended up sitting out the final four games prior to the All-Star break due to the ankle sprain, but there was never any serious doubt that he'd be available for Friday's contest following the extended rest. What was more surprising was that Vonleh took back the starting role at power forward, despite Maurice Harkless' exceptional play in his stead. Harkless still ended up seeing comparable playing time and narrowly outproduced Vonleh (11 points, eight boards in 25 minutes), while reserve power forward Meyers Leonard was limited to just five minutes. Vonleh had previously been splitting most of the minutes at the position with Leonard prior to his injury, and it looks like Harkless could simply take Leonard's place in that timeshare.

          Perhaps most incredibly, Lillard didn't turn the ball over once despite all his touches, becoming the first player since Reggie Miller in 1992 to score 50 or more with at least seven assists and no turnovers. Lillard has now scored 30 or more in three straight games and 20 or more in seven of his last eight, a streak he'll look to continue Sunday when the Blazers host the Jazz.

          Varejao was averaging just 10 minutes for the Cavaliers this season and his contract ultimately became too expensive when considering that Tristan Thompson, Timofey Mozgov, and Kevin Love handle most of the load in the frontcourt. It appears that Varejao will now have added chances to take the court in Portland, although coach Terry Stotts will likely deploy Mason Plumlee, Meyers Leonard, and Ed Davis at a higher rate since all three have shown progression as young upstarts. Nevertheless, Varejao's contract is guaranteed through the 2016-17 season with a player option for 2017-18, meaning the 33-year-old will likely have staying power in Portland, despite limited minutes. Varejao's move to Portland coincides with the Trail Blazers receiving a conditional first-round pick from the Cavaliers, Channing Frye heading to Cleveland, and Jared Cunningham moving to Orlando.

          For the second straight game, Lillard shot an ugly percentage from the field, but thanks to his ability to get to the free-throw line and convert at a high rate, he cleared 30 points for the 13th time on the season. He's hitting on 36.3 percent of his three-point attempts over the last three games -- right in line with his season-long percentage -- but since he's fired away a whopping 33 tries during that stretch, he's still buried at least three treys in each contest.

          The points and rebounds were both season highs for Harkless, who entered the starting lineup for the third time in four games despite the fact that Noah Vonleh (ankle) received clearance to return. Vonleh didn't end up seeing the floor, as coach Terry Stotts likely was only planning on using the big man in an emergency in order to give him some more extended time off in conjunction with the upcoming All-Star break. As a result, Harkless was the main beneficiary of an expanded role, and this performance could very well earn him some healthy court time in the contests to come, even if Vonleh eventually settles back in as the starter at power forward. Harkless is worth a speculative add in deeper formats, but those in shallower leagues may want to track his production for a few more games before investing.

          Lillard and Kyle Lowry waged an entertaining one-on-one battle, with the Blazers guard putting together a stellar stat line against Lowry's feisty defense. It was an encouraging bounce-back effort on the scoreboard for Lillard, who'd posted five sub-20-point performances in the eight games prior. Even as his point totals have been somewhat muted, the All-Star has served as an excellent ball distributor, posting double-digit dimes in three of his last six games, including two straight. While the added assists demonstrate the development of some alternative scoring options in Portland, Lillard can still be counted on as the linchpin on offense for the Blazers on the majority of nights.

          The four-year pro won his showdown with Kemba Walker, holding his Hornets counterpart to 14 points while playing some solid defense.

Lillard has only experienced a slight downturn in his averages for January, with his 23.6 points and 4.2 rebounds per game falling just slightly lower than his December numbers in those categories. Additionally, Lillard's assists have seen a notable uptick, with his 7.8 dimes per game this month representing his best monthly figure in that category since a three-game October sample, and possibly signifying the development of some alternative offensive weapons on the Blazers.

          Perhaps the only thing stopping Lillard from reaching a triple-double was his limited court time.

Now averaging 30.7 points with 9.7 dimes through his last three games, Lillard will bring his hot streak into Friday's match-up against the Nets.

The most encouraging sign for those who still hold the 23-year-old on their roster is that he received abundant opportunity, and posted a second straight double-digit scoring performance as a reserve. As he aptly demonstrated during his starting stint, Crabbe is capable of producing solid scoring and rebounding numbers when given sufficient time on the court.

          After a clerical error forced him to miss Wednesday's contest versus the Clippers, McCollum came out firing on Friday. Unfortunately for the Blazers and his fantasy owners, he posted a second consecutive sub-40 percent shooting night, as he and backcourt mate Damian Lillard frantically tried to keep up with Golden State's offensive barrage. McCollum's shot volume understandably had scaled back some since Lillard's return, but the third-year shooting guard remains a primary source of offensive production for Portland and therefore, a highly viable multi-format fantasy option.

          The All-Star point guard can officially be considered fully recovered from his recent foot ailment after this performance, which constituted his sixth double-double of the season. The scoring total represented a high-water mark on the campaign, and the six three-pointers were the most Lillard had tallied since he'd drained seven long-range buckets on Nov. 5 versus Memphis.

          After C.J.

          Henderson matched his season-high in scoring, which he set on Dec. 14 versus the Pelicans. Through 27 appearances, Henderson has earned 20 or more minutes nine times, with five of those occasions coming in the last two weeks. However, his playing time has been sparse this season, and will likely vanish further once Damian Lillard (foot) returns to the lineup. Over the past five contests, Henderson is posting seven points, three rebounds, one assist, and 0.4 blocks in 18 minutes per game.

He has taken on even more responsibility with Damian Lillard (foot) out, but McCollum still sees plenty of action as the primary ball-handler in pick-and-rolls even when sharing the floor with Lillard.

If he continues to have a bigger role in Portland's frontcourt rotation, he could become useful in deeper fantasy formats.

          The third-year pro spearheaded the shocking upset of the reigning Eastern Conference champs, and drained a season-high four three-pointers in the process.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/204025" class="ng-binding">Frazier played a full 48 minutes Monday, scoring 12 points (5-15 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 2-3 FT) with seven rebounds, seven assists, two steals, and a block in a 106-97 loss to the Hawks.</a></strong><br><br>
          With both C.J. McCollum and Damian Lillard unavailable to play Monday, Frazier found himself the only viable point guard on the team's depth chart. Eclipsing his previous season-high of 11 minutes played, Frazier drew a full game's worth of court time. The 25-year-old didn't have his best night from the field but filled out his stat sheet nicely, and surely earned respect from coach Terry Stotts for his endurance in a difficult game.

          Crabbe is averaging 24.2 minutes on 29 appearances this season, although his minute total could certainly exceed that average Monday. In fact, he's a great buy-low candidate for daily competitions since his playing time will head back to normal when McCollum returns from injury.

          Lillard typically starts at point guard while McCollum fills in any minutes when Lillard is on the bench, but the absences of both players leaves Frazier, the third-string man, as the top dog at the position. Though Frazier has averaged a meager 3.6 minutes in his 15 appearances this season, he should benefit from a season-high amount of playing time Monday, given the lack of the depth the Blazers have in the backcourt. With Lillard and McCollum out of the mix, only Frazier, Allen Crabbe (who could start at shooting guard Monday), Gerald Henderson, and little-used rookie Pat Connaughton offer the ability to play either of the guard spots. As a result, Frazier should be in line for huge minutes and will make for an outstanding value play at point guard for DFS lineups.

The point guard was spotted limping at a few points during the fourth quarter and said after afterward that he aggravated his injury a little bit, but it doesn't sound like he's concerned about the issue limiting him heading into Monday's tilt.

While a recent report said that he's earned praise from coach Terry Stotts, it will take more than this marginal impact on the box score for him to be worth looking at in most fantasy formats.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/203943" class="ng-binding">Vonleh continues to hold down the starting power forward job for the Trail Blazers, and has earned the praise of coach Terry Stotts, Erik Gundersen of The Columbian reports. "I think it's a great opportunity for Noah to play with the starters," Stotts sai</a></strong><br><br>
          Vonleh was expected to surrender the starting job when Meyers Leonard returned from a dislocated shoulder back in late November, but Stotts has continued to keep the 20-year-old with the first unit, due in large part to how well he complements the other starters. According to NBA.com, the Portland starting lineup of Lillard, McCollum, Al-Farouq Aminu, Vonleh, and Plumlee is outscoring opponents by 9.1 points per 100 possessions, making it one of the team's more effective units. However, because Vonleh rarely rates as a top option offensively and doesn't typically see more than 20 minutes of action, the starting role doesn't mean a whole lot from a fantasy perspective. He provided one of his best games of the season in Saturday's loss to the Knicks by collecting seven points (2-2 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT), five boards, two assists, and two steals, but that sort of performance won't do very much to move the needle in most fantasy formats.

          The All-Star point guard uncorked a season-high 28 shot attempts, and has now posted at least 21 attempts in three straight games. Lillard continues to be Portland's primary source of offense, and has a significantly high fantasy ceiling considering how many opportunities he has to score on a nightly basis. As a result of the considerable responsibility, Lillard is averaging a career-high 24.4 points, a figure notably higher than his 20.6 career figure in that category.

          The third-year pro managed a third straight outing with more than 20 points, and extended his streak with at least one three-pointer to 13 games. McCollum continues to rank right behind backcourt mate Damian Lillard in shots attempted, and is a dependable fantasy option in all formats at the moment due to the degree of offensive responsibility he shoulders nightly.

          Crabbe has now gone for double-digit points in all seven December games, and is proving to be an outstanding and dependable source of offensive production over the 25-35 minutes he's played nightly during the month. Crabbe's stellar streak of 15 consecutive games with at least one three-pointer was broken Saturday, but he is still averaging an excellent 15.4 points over 28.1 minutes in his last seven contests.

          The six-year pro bounced back from two sub-par performances to post his fifth double-double of the 2015-16 campaign. Aminu's 13 boards were also his second-best figure in that category this season, and were integral in the Blazers outrebounding the Suns 51 to 40 in the contest. The 25-year-old's ability to contribute across all categories, including from beyond the arc, have largely made his first season in a Portland uniform a success. On the campaign, Aminu is averaging a career-best 10.9 points along with 7.1 rebounds and 1.8 assists, while starting all 24 games.

          The third-year pro posted a second consecutive strong performance on the strength of his second-best shooting night of the season. McCollum managed to drain 66.7 percent of his 15 shot attempts, bringing his accuracy from the field to 58.8 percent (20-for-34) over the last two games. He's also caught fire from beyond the arc over that span, tallying an outstanding 56.2 percentage (9-for-16) from long range. As one of the primary sources of offense for the Blazers, McCollum has put up double-digit shot attempts in every game this season, giving him the considerably high ceiling that makes him an outstanding fantasy option in all formats.

          The third-year pro has now posted double-digit scoring performances in each of his six December contests, during which he's averaged a robust 28.3 minutes. The eight buckets Friday equaled his top figure on the season, as did the five boards he hauled in. On a Blazers team that constantly seeks additional offensive support for Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum, the 23-year-old Crabbe's strong shooting, three-point accuracy, and rebounding abilities appear to have earned him a consistent allotment of playing time that is enabling him to offer solid fantasy production.

          Aminu's unwillingness to look for his own shot is somewhat troubling given how many minutes he received, and his stock seems to be trending in the wrong direction. Over his last 10 games, Aminu is averaging 7.9 points, six boards, and 1.9 assists while shooting 33.8 percent from the field. If his struggles continue through the middle of December, he could start losing more playing time to the rising Allen Crabbe.

          Plumlee's production had started to take off during Meyers Leonard's absence due to a dislocated shoulder, but Leonard's subsequent return has diminished the production of both players. With coach Terry Stotts content to distribute the minutes fairly evenly between his four primary bigs (Plumlee, Leonard, Ed Davis, and Noah Vonleh), the Portland frontcourt remains worth avoiding outside of deep leagues. Plumlee has seen between 20 and 26 minutes in each of his last seven games and is averaging a modest 7.1 points, seven boards, 2.1 assists, 0.7 blocks, and 0.7 steals in that span.
