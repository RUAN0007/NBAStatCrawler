          The Hawks were down big in the first half, but Horford's exploits at both ends of the court helped them climb back into the game. He grabbed double-digit boards for the first time in a month, and he set season-highs in both steals and blocks. The versatility of Horford's game makes him a strong fantasy contributor more often than not, and nights like Monday are possible when he is at his best.

          A couple of days after nearly notching a triple-double against Milwaukee, the German sensation was crucial in helping Atlanta dig out of a big early hole. Schroder has developed a reputation for being an efficient producer relative to his playing time, but he has taken his game to a new level of late, with averages of 19.3 points, 6.5 assists and four rebounds over his last four. However, Schroder looks set to finish out the season as a reserve barring an injury, and his production will likely level off if that remains the case.

          Coach Mike Budenholzer said after Monday's morning shootaround that Teague was experiencing no problems with his wrist, which ended up limiting him to just 18 minutes of floor time in Saturday's contest. Teague missed over a full quarter of action while receiving treatment on the wrist Saturday, but exited the game shortly upon returning. It looks like Teague's quick pull was only for precautionary purposes, so he should be back to dominating the playing time at point guard after backup Dennis Schroder had one of the best nights of his career Saturday with 25 points, 10 assists, and eight rebounds over 40 minutes.

Players will go through slumps every now and again, but that seemed impossible for Millsap after the scorching-hot start he had to this season.

Moreover, the eight-month timetable suggests Splitter may not be completely healthy until mid-October, which could impact his availability for the start of the 2016-17 campaign.

          Bazmore wasn't himself on offense Monday, but he still managed to make a positive impact and earn 41 minutes. Over the last five games, he is averaging 11.8 points, 6.8 rebounds, 3.6 assists, and 1.4 steals in 30 minutes per appearance--but there might be more playing time to speak of if not for a 38-point blowout against the 76ers thrown in there. Bazemore is shooting 46 percent from the field and 40 percent from beyond the arc this season, but over these last five games he is down to 40 percent from the floor and 32 percent from deep. He will continue to get good looks in Atlanta's pass-happy offense, so for now owners should just be happy that he is finding other ways to contribute while his shot is off.

          Horford is easy to overlook in fantasy since he doesn't put up monstrous numbers most nights, but he is still averaging right around 15 points, seven boards, three assists, 1.5 blocks, one three, and one steal in 32 minutes per appearance this season. The Hawks are back in action on Wednesday versus a Bulls team that could still be dealing with injuries to key players, and Horford and company could really use a win heading into the All-Star break.

          The Hawks have already ruled Splitter out for the remainder of the first half, and the fact that he's set to receive a second opinion suggests the team isn't necessarily confident he'll be back immediately after the break.

          Bazemore's 23 points were his most since Jan. 20, and he appears to be trending in the right direction after beginning to see his court time wane a few weeks ago. He's seen over 30 minutes in five of the last seven contests and is averaging 12.1 points, 6.4 boards, 2.4 assists, 1.3 steals, and 1.3 three-pointers during that stretch.

          Teague saw a few extra minutes with Dennis Schroder leaving early with a chin laceration, but he'll likely fade closer to the 30-minute mark in Monday's rematch with the Magic, as Schroder seems likely to be available for that contest. Nonetheless, Teague seems to be trending upward after enduring a mostly rough January.

          Millsap hit three three-pointers for the fourth time this season, and this was his sixth game with four or more blocks. His last five games weren't impressive scoring performances, but he certainly did that well on Friday, posting his 22nd 20-plus point showing of 2015-16. Though he hauled in only two boards, Millsap more than made up for that with his hot shooting and stellar defensive stats, and this was a great bounce-back game for one of the league's most well-rounded players. Heading into the All-Star break, the Hawks have a home-and-away back-to-back set with the Magic on Sunday and Monday as well as a match-up with the Bulls in Chicago on Wednesday, and this stretch of games could be crucial for playoff seeding when all is said and done for the 30-22 Hawks.

          Horford had gone 13 straight games without reaching the 20-point mark. However, he has still been providing solid all-around numbers of late, and Atlanta earned its third straight victory.

          Tavares has bounced between the Hawks and the D-League as of late. It's unclear if he'll play much if at all now that he's been brought up. So far this season Tavares has appeared in just eight games and averaged only 7.3 minutes, so he shouldn't be looked to for much if any fantasy output.

          He was not placed on the injury report Saturday, so it would seem he can play through the ankle injury he suffered Friday against the Celtics. That said, Dennis Schroder is a more than capable backup, so he could spell Teague if the Hawks want to give him slightly less run than normal on Sunday.

          The scoring outburst ties his best performance of the season, as he lit the Kings up for 22 points exactly one month ago. Schroder has seen an uptick in his court time lately, averaging 25.7 minutes over the last three games, and he's responded with 17.3 points, 6.3 assists, 3.7 steals and 2.0 threes a night. With Jeff Teague slumping and now battling a minor ankle injury, Schroder could be an intriguing short-term play if you need backcourt help.

          Millsap continues to be the most consistent contributor on the Hawks, and he is also among the most well-rounded players in fantasy. Millsap was unsurprisingly unstoppable against the struggling 76ers, and he didn't need much time to do damage before sitting down to rest in garbage time.

          Schroder has now performed well in back-to-back games after a few weeks of ho-hum showings.

          Korver was cleared to play Monday despite a lingering ankle injury, only to miss each of his first six three-point attempts.

          Bazemore took advantage of his spot-start, to say the least -- the 26-year-old was inserted in the starting lineup following an injury to Thabo Sefolosha (ankle).

          Splitter's return from a seven-game absence led to diminished roles for bench bigs Mike Muscala (11 minutes) and Mike Scott, who didn't see the floor. It's expected that Splitter will eventually see his minutes settle back into the 15-to-20 range, which should offer some semblance of relief to the starting frontcourt of Paul Millsap and Al Horford.

          Millsap has been solid all season in contributing in all categories across the board.

Thabo Sefolosha meshed well with the starting unit in Bazemore's absence, and it appears Budenholzer is unwilling to change things up.

          Schroder managed to fill up the stat sheet fairly well despite the limited playing time, but with Jeff Teague dominating the minutes at point guard since returning to full health, it doesn't appear as though Schroder is a viable fantasy option any longer. He's seen 20 or fewer minutes in seven consecutive games and is averaging 6.3 points (on 30.8 percent shooting), 3.4 assists, 2.6 rebounds, and 1.4 steals during that span.

          Korver outplayed his fellow counterpart on the wing, former teammate DeMarre Carroll, while nailing exactly three treys for the sixth time in seven games. After last season's All-Star nod, Korver's counting stats are down across the board in 2015-16, but he's still delivering elite percentages from the floor (49.7%), free-throw line (81.3%), and beyond the arc (44.2%).

          Bazemore has seen between 20 and 26 minutes in each of his four games since returning from a sprained ankle, but the absence cost him his starting job, as coach Mike Budenholzer has elected to stick with Thabo Sefolosha as his small forward on the first unit. While a bench role isn't crippling to Bazemore's fantasy value, the fact that Sefolosha continues to see 30-plus minutes has worked against Bazemore. Those in deeper leagues will likely want to hold on to Bazemore a little longer in the event that he ultimately regains the larger share of the minutes, but for now, he's probably not worth keeping active.

          Splitter was limited at practice Tuesday and will miss a sixth straight game, though coach Mike Budenholzer noted that Splitter participated in nearly all of shootaround Wednesday morning. That's certainly an encouraging sign, and Splitter looks to be trending in the right direction in advance of Friday's matchup with the Lakers.

          Splitter was able to take part in portions of practice, but he continues to be limited by the hip injury that's kept him out of the last five games. In Splitter's absence, the Hawks have relied more on Mike Muscala off the bench, while Mike Scott has also seen a mild minutes boost. Atlanta has not announced a firm timetable for Splitter's return, but the fact that he was able to participate in part of Tuesday's practice is an indication that he's making progress.

          Millsap was absolutely bottled up against the Spurs over the weekend, but killed the Thunder inside and was a nightmare on the defensive end. Despite the poor outing Saturday, Millsap is averaging 20.8 points and 10.4 rebounds in his past five games while contributing in all five categories on a consistent basis.

          Horford has been a mystery this season, cleaning the glass and scoring at will on certain nights, but also disappearing on the boards and taking too many 3-pointers on others. It's somewhat of a testament to the Hawks' season, which has also been very up-and-down. Fortunately, Horford is still one of the better passing big men in the league, so when his rebounding is down, he still manages to help your fantasy squad.
