          Goodwin turned the ball over three times, but managed to post decent counting stats in the Suns' blowout loss. The fact that he saw so much floor time is undoubtedly a good sign considering he was down to just 24 minutes on Sunday, but making less than one-third of his jumpers isn't going to boost Goodwin's value in leagues that value shooting percentages and penalize turnovers.

The veteran big man sat out Sunday's loss to the Spurs, and it appears he's on the verge of doing the same Monday.

          Goodwin came off the bench after starting the last several games at point guard, and shared the available minutes at shooting guard with Devin Booker.

          Pressey turned the ball over four times and committed five fouls, but saw 28 minutes in his Suns' debut thanks in large part to Ronnie Price fouling out in 20 minutes. Suns' interim coach Earl Watson decided not to play Archie Goodwin at point guard on Sunday, and Goodwin split time with Devin Booker at shooting guard, allowing Pressey to earn meaningful minutes. Pressey averaged 3.9 points and 3.3 assists in 12 minutes per contest with the 76ers this season in 14 appearances, and even if Brandon Knight (groin) doesn't end up returning, Pressey is highly unlikely to be worth rostering in fantasy.

          Price received the start in place of Archie Goodwin, perhaps in an effort to allow Goodwin to play off the ball since his natural position is shooting guard.

The Suns' front-court is fairly crowded with several players who might struggle to separate themselves from each other in Humphries, Alex Len, Tyson Chandler (shoulder), Mirza Teletovic, and Jon Leuer, but Humphries provides the team with rebounding and outside shooting, and seems to be fitting in nicely with his new team thus far.

          Chandler appeared to injure his shoulder going after a loose ball midway through the second quarter of Friday's contest and went immediately back to the locker room. If he is unable to return Friday it'd be especially problematic for a Suns' team that is already playing without Alex Len (ankle). A further update on his status figures to be available after halftime Friday.

          Chandler suffered a strained right shoulder chasing down a loose ball midway through the second quarter of Friday's matchup with the Rockets. His return is questionable, and with time ticking down in the first half, it's unlikely that there will be any more confirmation on his status one way or the other until the Suns take the floor for the second half. If Chandler's night is over, he will have finished the game with two points and three rebounds over eight minutes of action.

          Len has popped for double-digit points in two of the last three games, but his minutes continue to remain quite variable, as the Suns have often showed a willingness to utilize smaller lineups where neither Len nor starting center Tyson Chandler are factors. That level of inconsistency makes Len difficult to keep active in season-long formats, though he'll occasionally provide value as a punt-play at the center spot in DFS when the matchup favors him.

However, because he relies so heavily on three-point production to maintain fantasy value, it's almost certain that his utility will come to an end as soon as he falls into the slightest shooting slump.

          Tucker has earned 31 minutes or more in nine straight games. He is the only Suns player capable of coming close to covering elite wings, or even stretch-fours for that matter. As a result, coach Earl Watson might have played Tucker the full 48 minutes if he hadn't fouled out. Still, Tucker is extremely inconsistent offensively, and he's hard to trust outside of deeper leagues even though he is tallying 39 minutes per contest over his last five appearances.

          The 26-year-old held his own in a tough battle with the Jazz's stalwart frontcourt, posting double-digit points for the fourth consecutive game while coming just a couple of rebounds short of a double-double. Morris did struggle for the field for the second straight game, and has now shot under 40 percent in four of the last five contests. He did drain multiple threes for the first time since Dec. 23 versus the Nuggets, and the big man's long-range shooting touch does help add a valuable dimension to his game and fantasy production.

Teletovic posted 15 points for the second straight night despite only averaging 19.5 minutes over the two contests. Although interim coach Earl Watson has openly expressed a desire for Markieff Morris to become a much bigger part of the offense--and has backed up his words by providing him with a significant boost in minutes--Teletovic appears still be slotted for sufficient playing time off the bench to provide decent value in points and rebounds.

Even seeing 25 minutes per contest this last month, Chandler has made for a forgettable fantasy option outside of category leagues in which you're desperate for rebounding.

          Booker was the only Suns to player to score 15 points or more on Sunday, with Tyson Chandler and Alex Len the lone two players who managed to shoot 50 percent or better from the field. Booker committed four turnovers, and he doesn't have an attractive assist-to-turnover ratio. Regardless, he has scored in double figures in 15 of his last 16 games, and he will likely be relied on heavily to score the ball going forward on a Suns team lacking any offensive firepower.

          A poor shooting night limited the impact of what was otherwise one of Tucker's most well-rounded stat lines of the season. The Suns are gradually getting healthier after a rash of injuries hit the team last week, but Tucker should still see above 30 minutes most nights.

          The injuries to Brandon Knight and Eric Bledsoe have really been a blessing for the Suns as Goodwin and rookie Devin Booker have emerged as real cornerstones. Goodwin has set a new season high in each of his past three games while scoring at least 20 points. He made most of his money at the rim and his six assists were also a season best. Goodwin likely won't remain cheap in daily formats for long and chances are he's been scooped up in most standard formats.

          Warren was curiously limited to three minutes off the bench in Tuesday's loss to the Pacers, but coach Jeff Hornacek seemed to attribute it to the second-year forward's lack of effort rather than an injury issue. However, it appears Warren is indeed banged up, and his absence from practice certainly isn't encouraging, given that three other forwards -- Markieff Morris (shoulder), Mirza Teletovic (ankle), and Jon Leuer (back) -- also missed Wednesday's session. If all of those players end up being sidelined for Thursday's game against the Spurs, the Suns would be down to just nine healthy bodies.

          Though Morris' shoulder injury isn't believed to be serious, it prevented him from taking the court in the second half of Tuesday's loss to the Pacers, limiting him to only 12 minutes on the evening. Unfortunately for the Suns, Morris is only one of several forwards that are nursing injuries, as all of Mirza Teletovic (ankle), T.J. Warren (ankle), and Jon Leuer (back) missed practice Wednesday. It's uncertain if any of those players will be available for Thursday's game against the Spurs.

          Price will miss his third consecutive game due to a sprain on his right big toe. He was suppose to take over the reins as starting point guard when Eric Bledsoe (knee) was ruled out for the season, but has only been able to start one game due to the toe injury. In his absence the Suns will rely heavily on their young guard talent, as rookie Devin Booker and Archie Goodwin should see a spike in minutes.

          The Kentucky product has filled in nicely for Eric Bledsoe since his injury and is slowly becoming a very reliable fantasy guard. He also benefited from Brandon Knight's absence Tuesday, but that hasn't stopped him from contributing. His shot hasn't been falling as much as you'd like, but Booker has used his size to average 5.3 boards per game in January. Booker has been in foul trouble often, but is a cheap option in DFS contests and is most likely available in 10- and even 12-team leagues.

His 3-point shooting has been exceptional, though he's benefited from a high volume of shots. Right now Teletovic should be owned in pretty much all formats and with the Suns pretty much giving up on the season, he should get plenty of playing time, as well as garbage points.

Len has since surrendered the starting job over to Tyson Chandler, who stands to see a fair increase in playing time during Len's absence so long as he can avoid foul trouble. Markieff Morris, who rejoined the rotation over the past weekend following a four-game exile, would likely provide fill-in minutes as the top backup to Chandler at center.

Even though Markieff Morris has since returned from his team-mandated two-game suspension, his relationship with the Suns and coach Jeff Hornacek may not be salvageable, which should allow Teletovic to maintain a spot ahead of him in the rotation. Teletovic has tallied double digits in the scoring column in four straight games and may be worth a pickup if he's still floating out there on the waiver wire.

          Morris saw 20 minutes in his first contest back from the two-game suspension he served back in late December, but he's fallen out of the rotation since that time. He's be a healthy scratch in the last four games, and with the Suns not in contention for a playoff berth, there's little reason for the franchise to give minutes to a player who has been a bad apple all season and is likely to be traded at some point.

          Warren's second game since returning to the bench went much better than his first, a scoreless dud against the Lakers back on Sunday. The 22-year-old was a key part of the Suns' long-range barrage, contributing three of the team's season-high 19 three-point field goals. Warren has often flashed the ability to provide ample supplementary scoring both as a starter and a bench player this season, but unfortunately, his bigger games are tougher to predict when he comes off the bench, as the 37 minutes he received Wednesday isn't typically the norm. That makes him a high-variance option in DFS, so he's best utilized in tournaments rather than cash games.

          After starting the previous five games in place of the injured Eric Bledsoe (knee), Booker moved to the bench Wednesday, allowing Ronnie Price to join the starting five to form a two-point guard backcourt with Brandon Knight. Booker still ended up seeing more playing time than Price (24 minutes), and appeared to rediscover his three-point touch after going 2-for-11 from downtown during his time as a starter. The rebound production was also impressive to see from Booker, but his modest season average of 1.7 boards suggests Wednesday's performance was likely an outlier. Even so, Booker is expected to continue to see ample minutes the rest of the season whether serving in a starting or bench role, and should offer value in deeper formats and as an inexpensive tournament value play in DFS due to his ability to occasionally rain three-pointers and clear 20 points in the scoring column.

          Price replaced Devin Booker in the starting five for Wednesday's game, and while he did see a modest uptick in the playing time he'd been averaging since Eric Bledsoe (knee) was ruled out for the season, Booker still saw more minutes (32). With just a 38.2 percent shooting mark from the field this season, Price likely won't have the green light to look for his own offense when he's on the court, especially when he shares the hardwood with the team's best player, Brandon Knight. Even if he sticks in a starting role, Price will have trouble delivering much value outside of deep formats.

          After Eric Bledsoe became sidelined for the remainder of the season, the Suns opted to give Booker the first shot at replacing him in the starting lineup. Booker had started the previous five games, but Phoenix will look to see what Ronnie Price has to offer Wednesday. They were expected to play around with different starting options before settling into something more permanent. It is unclear if Booker will remain in this reserve role or return to the starting lineup. Expect an update when prior to tip-off Friday.

          Warren recorded just one block and one turnover in 21 minutes of action on Sunday. The sophomore returned to a reserve role with Jon Leuer returning from an ankle injury and P.J.

Eric Bledsoe (knee) getting injured has resulted in things getting tougher for Knight offensively.
