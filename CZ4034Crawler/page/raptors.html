          The big-man missed out on his third consecutive double-double, but he was able to reach the 20-point plateau for just the second time in the last month. Valanciunas also saw his minutes dip after clearing 30 minutes played in each of the previous two games, but the Raptors' big lead likely played a part in that. Valanciunas has been productive since the All-Star break, and he looks set for a strong finish to the season if his playing time trends upward.

          The All-Star was extremely efficient in recording his first triple-double of the season, attempting just 13 shots and draining all of his free throws.

          The Raptors declined to provide an update on Lowry's status following their morning shootaround, so it looks like a formal ruling on his status won't come until closer to the 8:00 p.m. ET tip time. With the Knicks and Raptors playing in the second wave of games for the Thursday slate, those who are considering using Lowry for DFS may not have the benefit of knowing his status before lineups lock, making him a risky option.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/201960" class="ng-binding">The early estimate for Carroll's recovery from an arthroscopic procedure on his right knee ranges between six-and-eight weeks, Bruce Arthur of the Toronto Star reports.</a></strong><br><br>
          Carroll had been operating at less than 100 percent after returning for five games following a nine-game absence due to a right knee contusion, and after he experienced renewed swelling following Sunday's loss to the Bulls, both player and team determined surgery was needed to address the matter. The knee scope should improve Carroll's long-term outlook for the duration of his four-year, $60 million contract, but his multi-week absence will deprive the Raptors of their top perimeter defender and three-point threat right in the meat of the regular-season schedule. During Carroll's extended hiatus, coach Dwane Casey will give James Johnson the first opportunity to start at small forward, but the playing time will likely be distributed fairly fluidly between Johnson, Terrence Ross, and Patrick Patterson.

          The Raptors announced Wednesday morning that Carroll will undergo arthroscopic knee surgery, and while a timetable has not been released, Carroll figures to be in for an extended absence. As such, Johnson's insertion into the starting lineup will likely be semi-permanent, though coach Dwane Casey may also turn to Terrence Ross in certain situations. Regardless, both Johnson and Ross should see increased minutes throughout the duration of Carroll's absence. Johnson started in place of Carroll against Cleveland on Monday and finished with five points in 23 minutes.

          There is no clear timetable for Carroll's return, the Raptors will release more information when appropriate. Carroll missed nine games in December after he bruised his right knee. It appeared that he had overcome the injury, playing in five straight games, with coaching staff limiting him to 26 minutes per contest in order to prevent any further injury. However their efforts were in vain, as Carroll experienced more swelling on his knee earlier this week, which forced him to sit out of Monday's loss to the Cavaliers. The Raptors have now opted for surgery to hopefully put Carroll's knee troubles to rest. In his absence Terrence Ross and James Johnson will see more action at small forward.

          Johnson assumed most of the roughly 25 minutes DeMarre Carroll (knee) had been seeing as the starting small forward, but failed to do much with the opportunity. The swelling in Carroll's knee could force him to miss multiple games, but Johnson isn't likely to produce helpful counting stats even as he continues to see extended minutes.

          DeRozan isn't usually known for his prowess from downtown, but his three made treys were his most of the season.

          Scola is averaging 8.8 points on 38 percent from the field while adding 4.6 rebounds, 1.2 assists, and 0.8 steals in 22 minutes per game through the last five games. He has earned 30 or more minutes five times now this season, but predicting which nights that will happen is often the hard part. Expect Scola to continue seeing extended minutes with Jonas Valanciunas (hand) and DeMarre Carroll (knee) out of action, but don't expect Scola to play big minutes every night.

          Patterson has now seen 30 or more minutes in two of the past three games after failing to reach that mark during the first 20 games of the season. Patterson posted season-highs in minutes and steals on Wednesday, and could be in line to see similarly decent minute loads in the short-term with Jonas Valanciunas (hand) and DeMarre Carroll (knee) sidelined.

          DeRozan matched his season-high with six turnovers, but this was his best shooting night from the field all year. Entering Wednesday's contest, DeRozan was shooting 43 percent from the floor while scoring 21.1 points on 16.7 field goal attempts per game. He is shooting just 22 percent from beyond the arc though, so the fact that he is earning eight trips to the charity stripe per night is allowing him to remain fairly efficient. DeRozan is also averaging a career-high 4.3 assists per game through 23 games.

          Carroll is reported to miss an indefinite amount of time due to the right knee contusion. Unless this issue becomes more serious than a bruise, his absence isn't likely to be very long. Terrence Ross and James Johnson will likely see increased minutes in his absence.

          The Raptors were without three players due to injury Monday, prompting the call-ups of Wright and Bruno Caboclo to provide some added insurance off the bench. Neither player was called upon to play, and that will likely remain the case in any game that happens to be competitive during their stay with the parent club.
