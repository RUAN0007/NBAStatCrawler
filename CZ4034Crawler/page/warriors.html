Still, Thompson's specialized skillset makes him a valuable fantasy contributor, and he should continue to reward his owners from downtown.

The Warriors don't expect Festus Ezeli (knee) to return before April and don't seem too pleased with Marreese Speights' work on the defensive end, so there is some chance Varejao could get significant playing time when Bogut isn't available.

          Bogut recorded his 1,000th career block on Tuesday while posting his fourth double-double of the season.

          The 28-year-old has seen double-digit minutes in each of the last six games while Ezeli has remained out, so he figures to stick in the 10-to-20 minute range for the foreseeable future. That's probably not enough playing time for Speights to provide much consistent fantasy value, but he's occasionally shown the ability to post strong point totals on a per-minute basis.

After a four-game stretch where he'd successfully drained 54 percent of his 41 attempts from behind the arc, Thompson did struggle in that category Saturday, failing to hit multiple treys for the first time in five contests. Although he plays a clear second fiddle to Curry the majority of nights, the 25-year-old serves as a highly viable source of points and three-pointers that also offers 30-point-plus upside in any given contest.

          The eight-year veteran had a surprising role in the high-scoring affair, providing some key production in the second half to help keep the Thunder at bay.

We can chalk this one up to the Warriors being lackadaisical against the worst team in basketball, and nothing more. Green is still one of the top players in the NBA and Saturday was just a hiccup with the turnovers.

Blowouts have been fairly routine for the Warriors all season, so while Rush figures to see the floor more often than not, he'll see his minutes dwindle in more competitive games.

          Barbosa, who had missed eight games due to a shoulder injury, was activated for the Warriors' previous game, but never got off the bench so this marked his first game action since the Christmas Day win over Cleveland.

          With the Nuggets and the Lakers languishing at the bottom of the standings in the Western Conference, the Warriors are eyeing the back-to-back set as an opportunity to get some of their overworked veterans some rest while keeping their winning streak alive. Green, who has played in every game this season, along with Shaun Livingston and Andre Igoudala, are all expected to sit out at least one of the contests, though it's possible we won't receive confirmation on that front until shortly before tip off Wednesday. Those planning on targeting Warriors players for DFS players the next two days should steer clear of Green, who figures to see most of his minutes replaced by a combination of Marreese Speights, Harrison Barnes, and Jason Thompson.

          The Warriors' power forward fell just short of another double-double, put on one of his most impressive shooting performances of the season. Green was hot from the perimeter Saturday, with his five three-pointers equaling a season high. The 25-year-old now has at least 20 points in four of his last nine contests, and continues to be one of the elite multi-category sources of fantasy scoring in the league.

          After a quiet start to the new year, the veteran managed his first double-digit scoring performance since his 20-point outing against the Rockets on New Year's Eve. While he can't be relied on for consistent fantasy production, Iguodala continues to be an essential component of the Warriors' second unit that seems to be guaranteed at least 20 minutes per night. Saturday's solid scoring output was directly tied in to Iguodola also being more aggressive than usual with the ball, as his 10 shot attempts represented only the fourth time this season he's reached double figures in the category.

          The talented power forward's propensity for stuffing the stat sheet continued, as Green managed his fourth triple-double in the last five games. While two of those performances came in games that Stephen Curry missed and exited early, respectively, the 25-year-old managed Friday's feat with the reigning MVP playing a full 29 minutes. Notably, Green has tallied double-digit shot attempts only once over those five contests after having done so in 13 of the 14 games prior, but his rebounding and ability to set up teammates for scoring opportunities have been at an elite level recently. His ability to fill out all areas of the stat sheet even when his scoring totals are modest keep Green as a terrific fantasy option in all formats.

Despite Curry's presence for 29 minutes Friday, the status quo was preserved, with the fifth-year pro taking 22 shots and tallying 36 points for the second straight game. Thompson has averaged a robust 24.2 attempts and 33.2 points over the last five contests, and Friday's effort served to demostrate that he's capable of an elite level of fantasy production while sharing the backcourt with Curry.

Despite being less than 100 percent, Curry has still been effective of late, scoring 17 points in 26 minutes Tuesday and finishing with 30 points and four assists in 32 minutes Monday versus the Hornets.

          Livingston doesn't usually sit out one of the games in a back-to-back set, so having him not play is unusual. Particularly when he played just eight minutes in Monday night's win over Charlotte. Perhaps the Warriors saw these two games as an opportunity to give the 30-year-old guard some downtime after a stretch of having played elevated minutes due to injuries in the backcourt.

Thankfully, the 28-year-old journeyman also contributed on the glass with a new season-high in rebounds.

The Lakers were winning handily when Curry finally left to go to the locker room, so it may have simply been a precaution, but he definitely left Tuesday's game in worse shape than he entered it. Continue to follow this situation, as the Warriors can ill-afford to expose Curry to unnecessary risk in the regular season if the shin is still a legitimate issue.

          Curry was unable to finish Saturday's contest after taking a kick to his injured right shin, but he will have a chance to get back on the court Monday. If Curry is unable to go, Shaun Livingston is the favorite to get the start at point guard in his place.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/2733" class="ng-binding">Livingston was back to a reserve role in Saturday night's game against Denver, but helped to replace Stephen Curry, who left the game with a shin injury. He had eight points (3-5 FG, 2-2 FT) with three assists and two blocks in 25 minutes.</a></strong><br><br>
          Curry got hurt in the second quarter and left the game after just 14 minutes played, leaving ample opportunity for both Livingston and Ian Clark (37 minutes). With Curry missing all or parts of the last four games, Livingston's per game averages have surged to 26 minutes, 4.3 assists and 9.3 points. We'll need to monitor Curry's status to determine Livingston's projected workload heading into Monday night's home game against Charlotte.

          With Brandon Rush (hamstring) joining Harrison Barnes (ankle) in street clothes on the bench, the Warriors turned to Iguodala, who made his first start of the season. The coaches like to keep him on the second unit, no matter what injuries develop, but Golden State had only nine healthy players suit up Saturday. The available roster dropped to seven by game's end as Stephen Curry (shin) left the game and Andrew Bogut fouled out. With so much of the roster in flux, we're unsure where Iguodala will fit into the team's plans heading into Monday night's home game against Charlotte.

          Curry, who was accidentally kicked in the shin while playing defense in the second quarter, said the injury is in the same spot as the lower-leg bruise that forced him to miss two games earlier this week.

          The fourth-year pro came into the contest with a highly favorable matchup against the considerably vulnerable Nuggets frontcourt, and the opportunities ballooned after Stephen Curry exited early with a reoccurence of his shin contusion. Green managed his league-leading sixth triple-double, and has now incredibly hauled in 28 rebounds and dished out 30 assists over the last two games. The 25-year-old was hot from the opening tip Saturday, draining his first four attempts from beyond the arc, all within the first three and a half minutes of the first quarter. With Curry sitting for the entire second half, Green remained aggressive throughout, and consistently set up teammates for scoring opportunities as well. if Curry is forced to miss multiple games, Green figures to take on increased scoring responsibilities that will further enhance his already formidable fantasy appeal.
