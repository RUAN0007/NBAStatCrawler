          Barnes might be the player who benefits most from Courtney Lee and Jeff Green being dealt at the trade deadline.

As a result, he could very well improve his per game averages and enjoy a modest boost in production--though his already shaky field goal percentage (41 percent) might remain fairly low on most nights thanks to the fact that he will be receiving more attention than normal from opposing defenses.

While the team has not provided a timetable, Gasol is likely to miss several weeks, at the minimum, and if the fracture is severe enough, it's possible he could be lost for the remainder of the season. A more definitive update should be available within the next several hours, but consider Gasol sidelined without a timetable until the team says otherwise.

Though Gasol could still conceivably play Wednesday against the Nets, it's far from a given that he'll be available, which prompted the team to bring up Martin from the D-League. The rookie first-round pick has made just two appearances all season for the Grizzlies, but could be called upon to play off the bench Wednesday if Gasol can't go.

The bench role doesn't seem to faze Green's production, as he is averaging 28.8 minutes per game. Green is a safe add in season-long leagues if you haven't done so yet and also a decent spot play for DFS purposes against the right matchup.

          Barnes has been hot over the last four games, posting 12.0 points (48.4 FG, 50.0 3Pt, 100.0 FT), six rebounds, two assists, 0.5 steals, and 0.5 blocks in 28 minutes per night. Amid all the off-court concerns, Barnes is averaging a season-high 30 minutes per appearance in the month of January. His ability to cover multiple positions and stretch the floor with suitable three-point shooting has allowed him to earn a fairly prominent role regardless of whether he starts or not.

          With Mike Conley (Achilles) returning from a six-game absence, Chalmers was forced to hit the bench and settle for a reduced role. He provides an off-the-bounce game on a team lacking much in that area beyond Conley, so it's possible those two could share the floor for stretches at some point. Still, Grizzlies' coach Dave Joerger didn't elect to play the pair together Monday, and only receiving Conley's leftover minutes at point guard limits Chalmers' fantasy value.

He's expected to go through pregame warmups before being reevaluated, and an announcement on his availability or lack thereof should come shortly before the game's 1:30 ET tip off.

The scoring represented a season-high total for Gasol, who had come into the contest averaging only 13.9 points per game over seven January contests. While a level of production comparable to Saturday's would be unrealistic, Gasol is certainly capable of posting much better scoring totals than what he'd generated during the month prior to this 37-point outburst.

          With Mike Conley ruled out of Tuesday's match-up due to an Achilles injury, Chalmers was able to receive just his third start of the season.

While Chalmers has provided a welcome veteran presence since his Nov 10. acquisition from Miami, it appears he'll return to the bench once Conley returns from injury.

          The second-year UCLA product has appeared in only two games this season and has not seen the court since early November due to prolonged soreness in the knee, on which he underwent surgery back in August. It's unclear if the first procedure was ineffective, but Adams will undergo a second surgery, which Tillery reports is similar to the one teammate Brandan Wright underwent last month. The Grizzlies have not announced a recovery timetable for Adams, but Wright is expected to miss six-to-eight weeks, so Adams will likely follow a similar schedule.

          Performances like these, however sporadic they might be, are always welcome from the eight-year veteran by a scoring-needy Grizzlies squad. The 17-point output represented Lee's second double-digit scoring effort in the last three games, but only his third in the last eight contests. The minutes boost due to the extra period certainly helped, after Lee had played 27 minutes or less in the four games prior to Saturday. His shooting has been much improved over the last three contests (61.9 percent), and the 30-year-old has notably accomplished his last two double-digit scoring games while taking less than 10 shot attempts, a departure from the three previous outings in which he'd accomplished the feat.

          Even though he considerably struggled from the field, the nine-year vet managed his eighth straight double-digit scoring performance. While he's certainly been prone to cold spells from the field this season, Conley consistently contributes enough rebounds and assists to typically still provide solid fantasy value in games where his scoring suffers a downturn.

          The 12-year veteran contributed only his fifth double-digit scoring performance of the season, and his first since Dec. 11 versus the Hornets. The eight boards were a season high, and Allen's nine attempts from the field qualified as his most in a game since that same December contest against Charlotte. Allen has encouragingly taken 17 shots over the last two games, while receiving 36 minutes of playing time in each. While he can't be counted on for consistent scoring, increased involvement on offense such as what he's recently demonstrated would certainly serve to give a modest boost to his fantasy value.

He also put up a season-high 20 shots, following a pair of contests within the last four games where he had 18 attempts apiece.

          Randolph picked up the first of what will likely be two straight starts with Matt Barnes serving his two-game suspension.

          Don't look now, but Conley seems to be breaking out of his season-long slumber. He's gone off for at least 18 points in four of his last five contests, and while he's only shot 40.6 percent from the field during that stretch, Conley has helped his cause by getting to the free-throw line with more frequency. Aside from a drop in his shooting efficiency, Conley's numbers have remained relatively stable across the board compared to a season ago, and his 1.7 turnovers per game is his lowest mark since the 2008-09 campaign.

          Randolph took advantage of one of the league's least accomplished frontcourts, but now that he's coming off the bench, games with double-digit shot attempts should grow increasingly scarce. In his six games since being dropped from the starting lineup, Randolph is averaging only 9.5 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 2.3 assists in 23.7 minutes.

          Green had surpassed 30 minutes in five consecutive starts and 40 minutes on two of those occasions heading into Tuesday, but the matchup with the overmatched 76ers allowed coach Dave Joerger to give his bench players some more extended run. Look for Green's playing time to tick back upward in the Grizzlies' next game Wednesday at Washington.

          Tony Allen (knee) returned Tuesday from a five-game absence, but Lee retained his starting shooting guard role and didn't see a notable decline in his minutes; in fact, he actually saw more playing time than either of the previous two games. While starting six consecutive contests, Lee is averaging 11.2 points (on 48.2 percent shooting), 2.7 rebounds, two assists, 1.5 steals, and 1.2 three-pointers, numbers that should enable him to stay ahead of Allen in the rotation.

          Allen returned to the rotation after missing the past five games with a knee injury. However, the 34-year-old has lost his place in the starting five, and it's tough to trust him even in the deepest leagues given the Grizzlies' depth along the wing.

          Barnes continues to start over Zach Randolph and has turned into a valuable fantasy asset in deeper formats. He's been on fire from downtown as well, shooting over 40 percent from range in his past five games. Barnes makes for an intriguing DFS pick with his high usage and low salary.

          Gasol hasn't been a double-double machine this season, but is still managing to post enough points while contributing plenty of blocks and steals. His free throw percentage has been particularly high this season and Gasol is shooting 94.1 percent from the charity stripe in his past five games to go along with 17.2 points, 9.0 rebounds and 5.0 assists.
