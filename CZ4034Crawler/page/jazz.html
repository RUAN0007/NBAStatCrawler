          He's become a solid secondary scoring option for the Jazz, popping for double-digit points in 18 of his last 19 games with multiple three-pointers in 16 of those 19 games, but Hood has only scored 20 or more seven times over that stretch. As long as Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors remain the focal points of the offense, Hood's production upside will be limited, but the second-year guard has taken a clear step forward this season.

          It was quite a team debut for Mack, who was acquired by the Jazz from the Hawks prior to Thursday's trad deadline. Coach Quin Snyder wasted little time in finding a spot in the rotation for Mack, though it wasn't expected he'd see such ample minutes. He ended up outpacing starting point guard Raul Neto (10 minutes) and top backup Trey Burke (13 minutes) for court time, and while it's uncertain if that trend will hold in the games to come, Mack still might be worth keeping an eye on in deeper formats.

Gobert has rattled off five straight double-doubles, despite allowing some productive games to opposing centers in recent contests. Nevertheless, he's once again become a prolific source of production in rebounds, and is providing some solid point totals to complement that.

          The six-year veteran was upset by his performace the previous night against Washington, and appeared to take out his frustrations on a vulnerable Celtics frontcourt. The performance marked Favors' third double-double in eight February contests, and his fourth game during the month with 50 percent or better shooting from the field. He also encouragingly taken double-digit shot attempts in seven of the last eight outings, and figures to continue providing his typically solid production as long as he remains aggressive.

          The sixth-year pro took advantage of a favorable matchup against Jae Crowder, recording over 20 points for the fourth time in the last five games. His 15 visits to the charity stripe also equaled his second-highest total of the season, behind only the 16 free-throw attempts he made Jan. 14 versus the Kings. Hayward continues to roll along as one of the Jazz's primary sources of offensive production, particularly from the perimeter, despite scuffling with his long-range shot in recent games. Hayward is shooting a season-low 21 percent from behind the arc over eight February outings.

          The 23-year-old outshone backcourt mate Rodney Hood for a change, going perfect from field and draining multiple three-pointers for the third time in February. Neto appears to finally be hitting his stride offensively, posting double-digit scoring in four of eight February games after only having accomplished the feat in six other outings all season. While Hood figures to likely outproduce him on most nights, Neto is shaping up as an interesting option in deep season-long formats, and a still largely under-the-radar-play for the time being in daily leagues.

          Burke was one of the more surprising names that ultimately stayed put after Thursday's trade deadline, and he ended up playing his usual backup role off the bench for the Jazz while making a return from a three-game absence that preceded the All-Star break. Coach Quin Snyder continues to entrust the starting duties at point guard to the more defensively-focused Raul Neto, but Burke is essentially splitting the court time fairly evenly with Neto, who saw 21 minutes Thursday. The arrangement has put a ceiling on Burke's fantasy output throughout the season, and his appeal will only become more limited when Alec Burks (ankle) rejoins the mix at some point in the second half.

He's scored double-digits in all 10 of games since returning from injury, so there is some consistency in that aspect.

His 29 points is the second-highest scoring total of what has been an impressive season for the sixth-year man. Favors had been averaging 14.1 points on 46 percent shooting over his last eight games but this performance is a clear departure from that trend. Favors should continue his solid scoring and can contribute in rebounds and blocks as well.

          Booker took an inadvertent blow to the head during Thursday's outing with the Kings, which eventually forced him to sit out his next game on Saturday. After an extended rest, Booker has cleared the concussion protocol and should be available to play on Monday. With Derrick Favors dealing with a back injury as well, Booker could be relied upon to share the majority of the power forward minutes with Trey Lyles.

          Favors has missed 13 games in a row because of back spasms and has yet to receive clearance to return to the court. He's traveling with the Jazz to Charlotte for their game against the Hornets on Monday, which seems to indicate he's at least getting closer to a return. His status should be updated following Monday morning's shootaround, but he should be considered questionable until then. Rookie Trey Lyles will continue to start in Favors place until he's back to full strength.

          The second-year pro continues to produce, particularly from three-point range, where he's now tallying a stellar 48.9 success rate over the eight January contests he's been active for. Perhaps the most gratifying aspect of the Duke product's 2015-16 season so far for both the Jazz and fantasy owners has been the consistency with which he's been able to generate scoring, which wasn't always the case during his rookie campaign. Hood is enjoying an outstanding January overall, posting 17.0 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game.

          It was a vintage Stifle Tower performance, and one that both his fantasy owners and the Jazz had certainly been waiting on all season. Roy Hibbert and the rest of the Lakers frontcourt was simply no match for the seven-footer, who posted season highs in points and rebounds, and amassed his highest number of blocks since the second game of the season versus the Sixers. Gobert's point total was particularly refreshing, as he'd posted paltry two-and-three-point outings in hs previous two games, and only one other double-digit scoring effort since his return from injury on January 7.

          The 20-year-old continued his string of solid performances in Derrick Favors' (back) stead, posting his third straight double-digit scoring effort and coming just a rebound shy of his first career double-double. Lyles has been maximizing his shooting opportunities over that three-game stretch, shooting 67 percent (20-for-30) during that span, while impressively tallying a 55 percent success rate from beyond the arc. Possessing the coveted traits of size and a deft shooting touch, Lyles has been a silver lining in the wake of Favors' prolonged absence.

          Hayward put in a great deal of work to get over the 20-point mark, as he came up empty from beyond the arc and shot an abysmal 23 percent from the field overall. His season-high 16 visits to the charity stripe made up a bulk of his scoring total, which represented Hayward's third game of at least 20 points over the last four contests.

His 13 shot attempts Thursday were a career high, and represented the third game in January that he's hit double digits in that category.

His status is again up in the air for Sunday, so consider him questionable for Sunday's outing versus the Lakers at this point in time.

Gobert and Withey don't mesh on the court at the same time, so even Derrick Favors' (back) continued absence doesn't suggest Withey will retain his 20-minute average which was earned over the last 18 games.

Encouragingly, he was able to tally 28 minutes and put up numbers that with the exception of rebounds,  generally matched or exceeded his season averages.

          Jazz head coach Quin Snyder rode the hot hand Wednesday, as Burke represented one of his only sources of offense. Scoring all of his 23 points in the second half, Burke's 44 percent shooting from the field was a notable improvement over the team's combined 35 percent field goal percentage. With starting point guard Alec Burks out for at least six weeks with a fractured left fibula, Burke could stand to see an uptick in court time going forward.

          Booker's rebound tally ties a previous season-high set on Nov. 28. The former Clemson Tiger has consistently received minutes in Rudy Gobert's absence, but has otherwise posted erratic figures.

          It was the first double-double of the season for Withey, who made the most of Derrick Favors' second consecutive absence due to back spasms and also took advantage of one of the league's weaker frontcourts.

          Hood has now logged three consecutive double-digit performances, and is somewhat bouncing back from an otherwise disappointing December. Him getting at least 33 minutes over the past three games is a good indicator that he'll get more opportunities moving forward, so it may be worth being patient with him in spite of his lackluster month.

          Hayward is coming off three straight 20-plus point performances, so a cold game was due eventually. That didn't mean it had to come in the form of an abysmal 13-percent shooting night from the field -- by far his worst outing of the season in terms of field goal performance. That being said, he's not likely going to be rocking ice all season long, so expect him to bounce back soon.

          Burks has come off the bench the last two games and has seen his playing time suffer for it, as he's averaged just 10.5 points (on 42.9 percent shooting) in 18.5 minutes. The strong play of starting point guard Raul Neto during that span has contributed to Burks' demise, but due to Neto's limitations as a scorer, it's likely that Burks will gradually begin to see his minutes draw closer to 30 per game.

          He's quickly making the four-point dud against the Spurs on Dec. 14 look like a distant memory. Over his last three games, Hayward has gone over 20 points in all of those contests while draining nine three-pointers.

          Neto just recently made his way back into the starting lineup and he hasn't disappointed so far. He's averaging 9.3 points, two rebounds, 1.5 assists, and 1.5 threes over the last four games on 65 percent shooting from the field. While he probably won't keep up his hot shooting, he's still getting enough minutes to put up numbers sufficient for deep league ownership.

          Lyles has been in and out of the starting lineup with Rudy Gobert (knee) recovering from injury, but he hasn't necessarily made the most of his opportunities. Still, after a solid performance on Monday, he's worth having in extremely deep leagues because he's seeing around 20 minutes a night.

          Hood is averaging 12.4 points, three rebounds, one steal, and 1.6 treys over the last five games. Although he had some knee soreness issues lately, he's still been producing well enough in a variety of categories. Given that he's playing just under 30 minutes a night, he's likely going to maintain some sort of value throughout the season even though he'll have ups and downs.

          The third-year pro posted his ninth consecutive double-digit scoring performance, and continues to outperform starter Raul Neto. He's now drained at least one three-pointer in all nine December contests, and is averaging season-best averages in points, rebounds and assists during the current month. Burke's continued strong play may soon earn him the starting role, and with it, a significant increase in minutes.
