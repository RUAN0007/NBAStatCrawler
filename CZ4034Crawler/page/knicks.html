          Melo registered his seventh double-double in the last nine games Monday, as he once again logged heavy minutes despite the large deficit New York faced. Anthony also dished out five or more assists for the fifth time in that same span, and he is currently averaging a career-best 4.3 per game on the season.

          The big-man did plenty of damage in a relatively short amount of time, as New York trailed big and resorted to smaller lineups. Lopez came out of the All-Star break with a mediocre performance, but he has since racked up 47 points and 29 rebounds in two games--his best back-to-back performances of the season. Lopez has averaged 17.8 points and 11 rebounds since Derek Fisher was relieved of his coaching duties, and he seems to be putting his best foot forward under the current regime.

          Porzingis laid an egg in this one, getting thoroughly outplayed by fellow rookie Karl-Anthony Towns and battling foul trouble the entire contest.

This monster performance is reminiscent of his previous explosion back on Feb. 4, when the veteran center collected identical point and rebound totals against the Pistons. While this type of contribution can't be expected with any consistencies, Lopez plays a heavy chunk of minutes and remains a solid lower-tier fantasy center.

          Anthony is not expected to be rested down the stretch of the season, and Friday was fairly good evidence of that.

          Afflalo had a very unfavorable matchup on Friday, so there's not much reason to have concern moving forward. He'll have plenty of opportunities to get shots up in the Knicks' offense being the second option next to Carmelo Anthony. Afflalo's next matchup is against the Nuggets, his former squad and the fifth-worst team in the NBA against 3-point shooting.

          Calderon got himself officially reacquainted within the offense after seeing his first major load of minutes since returning from injury. With Carmelo Anthony sitting out, more Knicks were called upon to pick up the scoring load and Calderon answered the bell. Friday was a unique situation for the Knicks and it doesn't appear that Calderon will see the same success moving forward. Langston Galloway played major minutes when Calderon was injured and he may be provided more opportunities in the near future.

The 31-year-old has struggled in each of the last two games, shooting a combined 8-of-34 from the field with six turnovers. With Lance Thomas (concussion) also out for New York, the Knicks will be forced to lean heavily on Derrick Williams at small forward, with Thanasis Antetokounmpo, who recently signed a 10-day contract, potentially being thrust into an increased role.

Galloway is a much better defender than Calderon and you have to wonder if Knicks coach Derek Fisher will make a full-time change at the point guard position sometime soon.

Most people will point to the upper respiratory infection Porzingis had recently, but he could just be fatigued from the grind of the NBA schedule.

With that being said, we should see his status updated sometime closer to tip-off.

After averaging 18.6 points on 48.8 percent shooting during a nine-game stretch from Jan. 3 to Jan. 25, Afflalo has seen those numbers fall to 11.5 points and 34 percent in his last four contests.

          Earlier in the week, Anthony hinted that he was looking forward to playing against Oklahoma City on Tuesday, but he ultimately sat out the game due to soreness in his left knee. It's the same knee on which he underwent surgery last February, but Anthony said he does not believe there's a connection. Head coach Derek Fisher didn't sound quite so sure, emphasizing the need to continue evaluating the knee. "At this point it’s not, [but] you don’t know unless you continue to evaluate the situation," Fisher said. "At this point it’s just a sore left knee. We’re hopeful it will calm down soon. If something tells us otherwise, we’ll be smart and as we’ve always tried to be and make a decision that’s best."

          Porzingis was forced out of Monday's double-overtime win against the 76ers late in the fourth quarter with the sore right foot. His removal was initially expected to be precautionary, but the questionable designation suggests the injury might be slightly more serious than the Knicks are letting on. In any case, the team should have a better indication of Porzingis' availability following their morning shootaround Wednesday.

          Even though Carmelo Anthony (ankle) returned to a starting role and played 49 minutes Monday, Thomas was still able to see a steady amount of playing time, but there were a couple of circumstances working in his favor. Firstly, the Knicks lost Kristaps Porzingis late in the fourth quarter due to a foot injury, which created an opening for added playing time for Thomas. And secondly, the game lasted an extra 10 minutes because of the two overtime periods, which also granted Thomas more run. Assuming Porzingis returns in time for Wednesday's game against the Jazz, Thomas should see his playing time and fantasy value take a noticeable hit.

          Lopez secured double-digit rebounds for the second time in three games, but the double-double was his first since a similar effort versus Atlanta on Jan. 3. The center's role remains a bit inconsistent due to the versatility of rookie Kristaps Porzingis in the frontcourt, which allows the Knicks to experiment with different lineups. However, Lopez is averaging roughly 28 minutes per game over the last month, and has proven to be a reliable source of blocks and rebounds when the playing time is there.

          Porzingis exited the contest with just under three minutes remaining in regulation due to a sore right foot. It doesn't sound as though the Knicks will send Porzingis in for an MRI to determine if the injury is more severe than soreness, so there seems to be reason to believe he'll be back on the court for Wednesday's game. However, an official ruling on Porzingis' status likely won't come down until Wednesday's morning shootaround, if not closer to the start of the game.

After being replaced in the contest by Robin Lopez, Porzingis was examined briefly by the team trainer before the Knicks opted to rule him out. It's likely more for precautionary purposes more than anything else, but the Knicks will undoubtedly reevaluate the rookie after the game and determine if a more serious issue than a sore foot is at play.

          Despite x-rays coming back negative on his right ankle, Anthony was held out of Wednesday's game against the Nets in order to further recover from the injury. Anthony is again being listed as questionable prior to Saturday's outing, but we should see his status updated following Saturday morning's shootaround. The Knicks turned to Lance Thomas as a starter in Anthony's place on Wednesday, so they could opt to go with a similar plan of action Saturday if Anthony is still ailing. Derrick Williams would also likely continue to see an increase in minutes.

          X-rays conducted on Anthony's ankle after his departure came back negative, and while it appears he's avoided a long-term injury, it may be tough to ask the veteran to return for the second half of a back-to-back set. Even without Anthony's services, the Knicks should still be capable of defeating the hapless Nets, so there's some incentive for the team to give their star the night off. For what it's worth, coach Derek Fisher said a decision on Anthony's status for Wednesday likely won't be made until closer to tip off, according to ESPN New York's Ian Begley, so it appears the Knicks are leaving the door open for his return. In the event Anthony can't play, Lance Thomas would likely get the start at small forward, while Derrick Williams would stand to see some increased run off the bench.

          The Knicks are playing great basketball of late and Porzingis is a big reason why.

          The finger injury didn't force Porzingis to exit Saturday's contest, but it may have impacted his effectiveness, as he finished with only nine points on 3-of-10 shooting to go with two rebounds. X-rays after the came back negative to confirm that Porzingis didn't suffer any structural damage, but the lingering soreness could again inhibit him during Sunday's contest.

          Anthony took part in the Knicks' morning shootaround Wednesday before he was surprisingly ruled out of the contest later in the evening against the Cavaliers, but it doesn't sound like it was the result of any setback to the injured ankle. Instead, it appears the Knicks just wanted to proceed cautiously with their star forward with a game-heavy schedule on the docket. Anthony was able to take part in some shooting drills again Thursday, and with an additional day to rest up, it's expected that he'll reclaim his spot in the starting lineup Saturday and see his usual 30-plus minutes. In such a scenario, Lance Thomas, who scored eight points and added four boards and three assists while starting for Anthony on Wednesday, would head back to the bench.

          Williams posted his highest point total since the season opener. Still, he is a very unreliable fantasy option given that he doesn't get a lot of minutes.

          Anthony's defensive prowess continues to be a pleasant surprise this season, averaging 7.5 boards per game after just 6.6 last season. Posting a new season-high in assists Wednesday, Anthony has now averaged 26.7 points over his last three games. Anthony's impressive offensive performance should continue Friday against the 76ers.

          Afflalo and Carmelo Anthony combined for 49 points Wednesday, holding off the Timberwolves after outscoring them 33-14 in the second quarter. Afflalo's sharp shooting from downtown over his last two games brought an end to an 0-13 three-pointer streak from Dec. 5 - Dec. 10. Aside from his 29-point effort against Minnesota, and a 31-point barrage on Nov. 29, Afflalo seems more likely to fall in the 10-20 point range going forward.

          Aside from a strong 28-point effort at Madison Square Garden against the Mavericks on Dec. 7, Porzingis has been mostly invisible in four of the Knicks' last five games, all of which have come on the road. Porzingis seemed to hit a low point Saturday against the Trail Blazers, failing to score for the first time in his career while shooting 0-for-6 from the field and grabbing just three rebounds. Porzingis was limited to just 19 minutes in that contest, and it's possible the Knicks could attempt to reduce his playing time more frequently during game-heavy stretches. Fortunately for the rookie, the Knicks won't play again until Wednesday against the Timberwolves, giving the 20-year-old some time to recover from the forgettable road trip.

          Like teammate Robin Lopez, Afflalo made a successful return to Portland, posting his sixth double-digit scoring game in the last eight contests. The veteran guard also broke a four-game drought from long range, draining a pair of three-pointers. Despite some productive outings during the month, Afflalo's 11.9 points per game in December is still below his 13.2 figure from November.

          It was an considerably efficient performance for the big man, who managed double-digit points for first time since a Halloween tilt versus the Wizards. It was also the third consecutive productive effort for the four-year pro, following a five-game stretch in which he played only seven total minutes and failed to come off the bench altogether in three of those contests. O'Quinn has generally been productive in his first Knicks season when given the opportunity, averaging 5.0 points and 4.4 rebounds over just 12.8 minutes this season.

          The reserve forward continues to play well when given the opportunity, with Saturday marking the fifth time in seven December contests that he's managed double-digit points while tallying no more than 27 minutes on the court. He's also drained at least one three-pointer in six straight, and his six visits to the charity stripe were a season high. Thomas is providing outstanding overall production in a high-usage reserve role, and is now averaging 11.1 points in seven games this month.
