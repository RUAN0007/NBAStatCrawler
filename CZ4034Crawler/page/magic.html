          Payton played fewer minutes than recently acquired guard Brandon Jennings, and Payton is simply a non-threat to score on offense due to his inability to sink the most wide open shots. In the two games since Jennings' arrival, Payton is averaging 6.5 points, 3.5 assists, 2.5 rebounds, one steal, and 0.5 blocks in 26 minutes per contest, and while it may not be time to panic, the sophomore who turns 22 on Monday still has a lot of growing up to before he proves worthy of a starting point guard job in the NBA.

Overall, he has progressed well this season, but those who decided to take a flier on him when Harris was moved before the trade deadline have every right to be disappointed with Hezonja's production. There will still be nights when the rookie plays more meaningful minutes, but it's also clear that coach Scott Skiles isn't going to throw the soon-to-be 21-year-old into positions where he doesn't feel the rookie has a decent chance of helping the team succeed.

At this point, with Tobias Harris shipped off to Detroit, the biggest threat to Fournier's playing time is an emerging Aaron Gordon, especially since the acquisition of Ersan Ilyasova means Gordon won't be getting as much time at the four spot.

          Ilyasova could become an instant starter for the Magic at power forward if coach Scott Skiles elects to bring Aaron Gordon off the bench. Either way, the departure of Harris should boost Gordon's fantasy value due to a slight increase in expected minutes, while Ilyasova's value may not fluctuate much. He averaged 11.3 points, 5.4 rebounds, 1.1 assists, and 28 minutes per game through 52 games with the Pistons this season.

          Gordon has received 24 minutes in both games since receiving the promotion into the starting lineup. While he fouled out of last Friday's match-up with the Hornets, Gordon had only one foul in Monday's overtime contest against Orlando. Meanwhile, former Magic starter Channing Frye played only 12 minutes on Monday, as Nikola Vucevic, Tobias Harris, Elfrid Payton, Victor Oladipo, and Evan Fournier each saw 35 or more. Gordon is averaging 20 minutes per game on the season, so he has still been enjoying a slight uptick in playing time during the month. However, he will likely need a few more minutes per game in order to make a serious impact in standard-sized leagues.

          Payton reclaimed a spot in the starting lineup at point guard with Victor Oladipo (knee) ruled out, and while he shot the ball well from the field, he failed to make much of an impact as a distributor. In his two games since returning from an ankle injury, Payton has nine assists and eight turnovers, numbers that a far from ideal for a point guard. Payton hasn't made a strong push to hold down a starting role once Oladipo returns, but he'll get at least another turn as the Magic's primary floor general with the team already indicating that Oladipo will be unavailable for Wednesday's tilt with the 76ers.

          Oladipo had been locked into a limited role off the bench over the past month with rotation changes by coach Scott Skiles, but Oladipo now has a short-term opportunity to produce more than expected for the duration of Payton's absence. Although, Shabazz Napier could also find a way to absorb some of Payton's minutes at point guard.

          Payton was subbed out of the game early in the first quarter and did not return to the court. He warmed up before the second half began, but remained on the bench for its entirety. Magic coach Scott Skiles said post-game that Payton wasn't feeling well in the beginning of the game, and that he wasn't moving that great either. He came into the game nursing an ankle ailment he suffered in Tuesday's practice, but the fact that he hung out on the bench means his injury is likely not overly serious. Still, the Magic will exercise caution with their young, budding point guard, and it's possible Payton will be held out for a game or two in order to facilitate his return to full health.

          Napier earned the start to open the third quarter on Wednesday with Elfrid Payton dealing with an ankle injury and an illness and C.J.

          Payton doesn't have the three-ball in his arsenal and he isn't a reliable free-throw shooter, but the Magic's sophomore guard is having an extremely well-rounded season regardless. At 21, he is already a factor on defense, and he is shooting the ball well from the field overall while recording an admirable assist-to-turnover ratio.

          Fournier finally showed some signs of life on Wednesday after connecting on only 10-of-34 from the field over the previous five games. After earning 30 or more minutes in 11 of the Magic's first 13 contests, Fournier has seen 30 or more minutes in only two of the 12 games since. Coach Scott Skiles' lineup adjustments are paying dividends in the win column for Orlando, but the changes aren't necessarily helping boost the fantasy value of Fournier or fellow Magic shooting guard Victor Oladipo, who have essentially split minutes on some nights.

It's encouraging to see him go more aggressive on the glass, as he's averaging under nine for the season (compared to 10 for his career). He's not a blocks or steals specialist, so owners will need him to continue to put up lots of rebounds to make up for his defensive deficiency. He's poised to keep this up over the next few weeks as long as he's healthy.

He missed a potential game-tying three with seconds left, ultimately leading to the loss.</a></strong><br><br>
          Fournier has been struggling lately, scoring just a total of 10 points over two games prior to Wednesday's contest. It's encouraging to see him log 35 minutes on Wednesday -- the most he's put up since Nov. 21. While there's no evidence that his role as a starter is in danger, it is worth noting that his minutes have seen a dip over the recent stretch, and hopefully Wednesday's outcome doesn't make his situation worse.

          Gordon returned from a one-game absence and was able to put up some solid numbers (on a per-48 minute basis) in Tuesday's game. He's still just playing under 20 minutes a game for the season, and it's not clear that he's going to see much more than that in the meantime. However, his ability to score, grab boards, and put up blocks when given the minutes makes him a low-end option in deep formats with sleeper potential.

          Nicholson hasn't played this few minutes since Nov. 21, and limited time on the court obviously hampered his production on Tuesday. He also drew five personal fouls, which made it hard for him to stay on the court, so owners may not need to panic yet. It's unclear if he'll continue to be playing 20-plus minutes a game, or if he'll eventually dwindle down to being a bench warmer, but we'll probably have a good idea after observing the next few games.

          Gordon missed Tuesday's tilt in Denver after spraining his ankle in practice Sunday. Fortunately, the sprain was not too serious, and it sounds like he will be able to return to action against the Suns. He will likely take on his normal workload.

          Oladipo suffered a left knee injury in Saturday's loss to the Clippers but it didn't appear to slow him down on Tuesday night.

          Fournier has now scored a total of just 10 points over the last two games, and is seeing his minutes taking a hit over the last five contests (24 MPG). With Victor Oladipo still coming off the bench, Fournier's minutes are always in danger, and his poor play recently is rather concerning. He still holds quite a bit of fantasy value, so if there's a chance to sell him high now, it may not be too late. Owners who decide to keep him can at least take into consideration that he's picked up 14 personal fouls over the last three games, which could be a reason for his underperforming.
