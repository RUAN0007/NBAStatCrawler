          Redick was able to get a good amount of shots in this game, but unfortunately, it couldn't translate into a win for the Clippers. Look for Redick to compete for secondary shots along with DeAndre Jordan and Jamal Crawford while Blake Griffin is out until mid-March. In the DFS game, it's best to leave Redick off your roster unless there's a favorable matchup. However, in season-long leagues, he is still playable each night.

          Jordan did what was expected of him against the penetrable frontcourt defense of the Celtics on Wednesday. With the game going to overtime, Jordan was also able to accumulate some additional stats which made it a great night all-around. Having Blake Griffin out of the lineup has done wonders for Jordan's fantasy production and that will continue until mid-March when he returns. The only thing holding Jordan back from being a must-start in the DFS format is his free-throw shooting, but he did go 9-for-17, so maybe there is hope on the horizon.

Sunday's effort concludes a fine January for Jordan, as he raised his game in the prolonged absence of Blake Griffin to average 15 rebounds, 13.8 points and 1.8 blocks on 69 percent shooting.

          After it was revealed earlier last week that Griffin fractured his hand while punching the Clippers' assistant equipment manager during an altercation in Toronto, the team projected him to miss four-to-six weeks. A two-month absence would give Griffin only two weeks of regular-season games before the playoffs begin, so fantasy owners in shallower formats without DL spots could be inclined to drop the big man from their roster if it becomes clear that he'll be out longer than initially anticipated.

          The six-year veteran's performance came out of nowhere, after Stephenson hadn't left the bench in the last two games, had also failed to play in five others in January, and had tallied single-digit minute totals in the four other contests he'd participated in during the month. Stephenson's highly efficient effort was certainly encouraging, but given his usage history to date in a Clippers uniform, not even remotely trustworthy in terms of projecting fortchoming fantasy production.

          In what's become the biggest story of the day, Griffin reportedly was involved in an altercation with a team equipment manager, leaving the All-Star with a broken hand. Griffin was already sitting out while rehabbing a quad injury, but this latest ailment will now keep him on the shelf until late-February or early-March. At this point, it's unclear whether Griffin could face additional discipline for the incident from the league or the Clippers.

During Griffin's absence, the team has rolled to an 11-3 record, but they'd surely welcome the return of their top offensive threat in the low post.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/201933" class="ng-binding">The Clippers are hoping to have Griffin (quadriceps) available for the first game of their upcoming five-game road trip that begins Thursday in Cleveland, but it's more likely that the forward won't make his return until Jan. 24 against the Raptors or Jan</a></strong><br><br>
          Griffin, who has been able to do some light on-court work since suffering the partial tear to his left quadriceps tendon back in late December, has yet to practice in full with the team, though that could occur at some point this week before the Clippers head out on their trip. The team should provide an update on Griffin's status before departing for the road, but those who have been holding the forward in season-long formats may want to just keep stashing him on the bench until more clarity on his situation is presented. Even if Griffin is cleared to play in the first game of the road trip against the Cavaliers, there's a decent chance he'd be held out Friday against the Knicks in the second half of a back-to-back set.

          Jordan has missed the Clippers' last two games while recovering from pneumonia, an illness that ended his streak of 360 consecutive contests played. The team should provide more clarity on Jordan's health following their morning shootaround Monday, but if the center is cleared to play, he'd likely assume a relatively normal minutes load in his matchup with Dwight Howard. Cole Aldrich would draw a third straight start if Jordan is again ruled out.

          The veteran sharpshooter bounced back nicely from a couple of sub-par shooting efforts, coming just a point short of matching his combined scoring output from the previous two games. Key to the scoring total was Redick equaling his second-highest amount of three-pointers on the season, and posting multiple treys for the fifth time in six January contests. The 10-year veteran is enjoying a solid month so far, shooting 49.3 from the field, 50 percent from three-point range, and averaging 16.3 points per game.

Aldrich has shot a solid 54 percent (15-for-28) over that span, and has been a solid presence on the glass. While his stint of starts will come to an end as soon as Jordan is able to return, Aldrich remains a terrific near-minimum price option in daily leagues as long as he is able to receive starter's minutes.

Whether coach Doc Rivers is thinking the same thing remains to be seen, though, so we'll have to wait for further updates as the week goes on.

After sitting out Wednesday's game against the Heat, Jordan will have one more day off before potentially returning to the lineup Saturday. Cole Aldrich took his place in the starting lineup Wednesday, so the Clippers could opt to go that route again if Jordan's illness remains.

While he is still scuffling some with his shot, Crawford provides the veteran leadership and scoring punch that can help the Clippers fill the offensive void left by Blake Griffin's absence due to his quadriceps injury. He typically won't receive more than 25-28 minutes when coming off the bench, but can efficiently light up the scoreboard over that span when his shot is falling.

          Pierce was held out of Monday's tilt with the Thunder to rest a sore back, but his return to full practice Thursday suggests that his absence won't extend beyond that game. Look for him to see around 10-to-15 minutes Friday, as coach Doc Rivers continues to divvy up the minutes between his small forward quartet of Pierce, starter Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, Wesley Johnson, and Lance Stephenson.

          Even though the game was tightly contested throughout, Smith has typically found himself in the rotation under such circumstances, but coach Doc Rivers opted to go in a different direction Monday. The writing was on the wall after Smith saw just six minutes in the Clippers' previous game against the Rockets on Saturday, but he dropped off the grid entirely Monday, with Rivers turning to Cole Aldrich (14 minutes) for frontcourt assistance. Aldrich fared well in the outing, so it's possible he could continue to rank ahead of Smith in the pecking order over the next few contests.

          That's the third time in four games that Redick has scored 20 or more points as the veteran sharpshooter is averaging a gaudy 19.4 points while shooting 46 percent from downtown over his past five games.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/1718" class="ng-binding">Pierce is averaging just 8.8 minutes over six games thus far in December.</a></strong><br><br>
          After reuniting with coach Doc Rivers in Los Angeles this offseason, it was widely expected that Pierce would claim the starting small forward job and provide some complementary scoring while giving the Clippers around 20-to-25 minutes per night, but even that modest role has been too much to ask for the 38-year-old. He's since fallen behind Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, Wesley Johnson, and Lance Stephenson in Rivers' rotation, and doesn't offer much more than a positive locker room presence at this stage of his career. Pierce, who is averaging just 4.2 points on the campaign, has been held scoreless in six games. That's three more games than he had been held scoreless for his prior 17 seasons combined.

          It's his seventh straight game with double-digit rebounds, as Jordan sits comfortably in second place in the league with 13.4 boards a game. He's also averaging a career-high 8.0 free throw attempts a night while shooting just 38.9 percent from the line, as teams increasingly try to intentionally foul him late in close games. In fantasy formats where his poor free-throw shooting is a liability, his value is actually on the decline due to that increased volume.

          It's his second double-double in four games since returning to the court from a rib injury. Paul's numbers are down a little this season due to a variety of minor, nagging injuries, but if he can stay healthy for an extended stretch his production should bounce back.

          He's been running hot and cold since returning to action from a minor ankle injury, but Redick was on fire from beyond the arc on Saturday. He'll try to maintain his momentum Monday when the Clippers visit Detroit.

          He was on his best behavior one game after getting ejected, and Griffin went the entire night without picking up a personal foul for just the third time this season. He also came within one rebound of extending his double-double streak to five games, and Griffin is now averaging 20.4 points, 10.6 boards and 4.8 assists in December.

          Fresh off a season-high 18-assist performance a day earlier against Milwaukee, Paul struggled to get in going in the second game of a back-to-back set, and it didn't help matters when running mate Blake Griffin was ejected midway through the third quarter. Perhaps Paul was simply just feeling the effects of fatigue while playing 30-plus minutes for the second straight night, and with the point guard enduring no setbacks since returning from a ribs injury, fantasy owners should have little concern about him for the long haul.

          Just one day removed from a season-high 31 points, Redick went just 2-for-11 from the field, tallying only eight points in a loss to Chicago. Austin Rivers and Jamal Crawford weren't much better in Doc Rivers' second unit (1-6 FG and 1-5 FG, respectively), so Redick's playing time should be safe.
