          Asik lasted only seven minutes in Sunday's win over the Pistons before departing with a right ankle sprain, ending his outing with five points and one rebound. He underwent an MRI on Monday, but the results of those tests have yet to be revealed. Until the Pelicans indicate otherwise, it looks like Asik will be evaluated on a game-to-game basis, though it appears he'll be unfit to play Tuesday. Look for either Alexis Ajinca or Kendrick Perkins to pick up the start at center in place of Asik.

          Asik sprained his right ankle in the first quarter of Sunday's win over the Pistons and didn't return to action, ending his outing with five points and one rebound in seven minutes. He was navigating around the locker room with crutches after the contest, but the Pelicans' medical staff may have just advised the center to use the crutches as a precaution to avoid worsening the injury. In any event, Monday's evaluation should provide more clarity on the extent of Asik's setback, as well as an indication of his availability for the Pelicans' next game Tuesday against the Wizards. Alexis Ajinca or Kendrick Perkins would likely pick up the start at center if Asik can't play Tuesday.

Anderson has continued the streakiness he displayed prior to the All-Star break, as he registered 26 points Friday prior to Sunday's dud.

Holiday continues to come off the bench as his minutes are monitored to an extent, but he has posted exceptional averages of 20.5 points, 7.6 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 2.0 steals in just 30 minutes per game over the last month. New Orleans' lack of depth virtually ensures that Holiday will see heavy usage on a nightly basis, and he is resembling the player who was a fantasy star just a couple of seasons ago.

The two sides met prior to the All-Star Game, and Dejean-Jones' camp is reportedly seeking a multi-year deal, while the Pelicans are hesitant to commit, given their desire to keep a roster spot open should they make a deal prior to Thursday's deadline. The belief is that Dejean-Jones would prefer to stay with New Orleans, but if the Pelicans wait too long or refuse to commit to a longer-term deal, Dejean-Jones could look elsewhere.

Cole played reasonably well against Russell Westbrook, and upped his aggressiveness on offense in light of the matchup. The five-year veteran's shot attempts were back in the teens after back-to-back games under that figure, and the four visits to the charity stripe equaled a season high. With the news that Evans will now miss the remainder of the season, the Cleveland State product figures to have extended opportunity to develop his game. Cole heads into the All-Star break with 11 double-digit scoring outings in his last 12 games, and solid averages of 14.3 points, 5.3 assists, 2.3 rebounds and 1.2 steals over 29.0 minutes in seven February contests.

          Evans had a second opinion taken on his knee tendinitis, but the result was the same and he was encouraged to undergo surgery. That surgery occurred on Thursday and was successful, which rules Evans out for the remainder of the 2015-16 season. Evans has one year left on his current contract and will be back with Pelicans next year with a cap hit of just over $10 million. A concrete recovery timetable has yet to be determined, so it remains unclear if he'll be ready to go come training camp.

Once the Pelicans have gathered sufficient information from medical experts, an update on Evans' status should be provided, but the fact that a season-ending procedure even remains a possibility for the 26-year-old is quite worrisome.

It appears he hasn't progressed in his recovery since being shut down, and with the Pelicans seemingly out of the running for the postseason, Evans has little incentive to play through the injury at less than 100 percent health. If Evans indeed goes under the knife again, it would mark his third procedure on the right knee since May, and it's fair to wonder if the 26-year-old will ever be able to stay on the court for a full season over the remainder of his career. The Pelicans were said to be shopping Evans with the hope of finding a suitor for his services, but the prospect of a season-ending surgery will end those discussions.

          Asik's done a solid job clearing the glass lately with double-digit boards in four of the last six games, but he's a liability in just about every other category. He's scored no more than eight points during that six-game stretch, and is averaging only 0.5 blocks, 0.4 assists, and 0.2 steals on the season.

          This does not come as a big surprise, as he has now missed five straight games, and is about to miss his sixth in a row on Saturday against the Cavaliers.

          Somehow Cunningham played 32 minutes in the Pelicans' last game and attempted just one shot from the field, so he is anything but a safe option with Tyreke Evans out. That said, he probably offers a bit more multi-category upside than Gee.

          Davis' point-per-minute output kept the Pelicans in the game, as he was only one of two New Orleans starters to manage double-digit scoring. He unsurprisingly dominated the Lakers' frontcourt on the night, en route to his third double-double in the last four contests. As long as he can avoid the multiple early exits he's endured this year due to various injuries, Davis is obviously a top-end producer in any fantasy format. He may be taking his game up to another level as the season nears the All-Star Break, as the four-year pro is already averaging a season-best 30.0 points per game over three February contests, while also hauling in 10 boards per night over that span.

          The 23-year-old has been a nice find for the Pelicans in the wake of Eric Gordon's finger injury, and helped keep New Orleans afloat Thursday on a night where multiple starters struggled. Both the minutes and the point total were season highs, while his nine rebounds equaled the amount he'd hauled in against the Nets on Jan. 30. Dejean-Jones appears to be guaranteed an appreciable amount of playing time for the time being with Gordon's continued absence, and has proven to be a nice source of rebounds so far, particularly for a two-guard. He's now averaging 7.4 points and 4.0 rebounds over 21.1 minutes over the eight games he's appeared in, with five of those being starts.

Despite the fact that he is still coming off the bench, Holiday is a valuable commodity across all fantasy formats.

          The Pelicans really needed Holiday to step up in this game with Tyreke Evans (knee) still sidelined, but the point guard couldn't come through, as he was bottled up by the Grizzlies' backcourt trio of Mike Conley, Tony Allen, and Mario Chalmers.

          Evans has been experiencing tendinitis in his right knee of late, and while an MRI revealed no structural damage, the Pelicans will take steps to prevent the tendinitis from worsening. Coach Alvin Gentry said that he'd like to cut Evans' minutes down to roughly 24 per game in an effort to protect the versatile guard, who's averaging 30 minutes per game on the year. "I've got to monitor it more for his own protection," Gentry said. "He's the type of guy that's going to get out there and try to play. If it's hurting him, then we just got to limit his minutes. If he's sitting out, he's sitting out." Evans is currently considered questionable to play Thursday against the Kings. Whether he plays Thursday or not, his fantasy value could take a fairly significant hit if Gentry follows through with the minutes restriction.

          The game was a rather average one by Davis' standards, but the strong production in the steals and blocks categories was a nice development for fantasy owners.

          Holiday got his shot back on track on Monday after shooting under 50 percent from the field in the previous six games. Tyreke Evans has missed a few games of late with knee soreness--including Monday--but Norris Cole has drawn the starts in those games. After shooting 49 percent on both twos and threes and 80 percent from the charity stripe in 25 minutes per game during December, Holiday's percentages have dipped in January while his minutes have risen to 30 per game. Nevertheless, Holiday is playing without restrictions, and he is averaging 17.0 points (41.7 FG, 17.6 3Pt, 85.7 FT) on 16.8 shots, 7.4 assists to 1.8 turnovers, 5.4 rebounds, and 0.8 steals in 29 minutes per game over his last five appearances.

If Evans' injury proves problematic long-term, Cole could have decent value in deep leagues since he and Holiday play plenty of minutes together with the latter covering the bigger guard.

It was Holiday's second straight game with double-digit assists, and his numbers in January (15.4 points, 6.1 assists, 4.9 boards and 1.6 steals in 30.3 minutes over seven games) are looking a lot more like his pre-injury form.

          Davis has missed back-to-back contests due to a back contusion, and it wouldn't surprise if he misses a third with the Pelicans' next outing landing against the Hornets on Friday. Another absence would likely result in Ryan Anderson entering the starting five yet again.

          Anderson has now played a team-high in minutes in each of the past two games with Anthony Davis (back) sidelined. For whatever reason, coach Alvin Gentry prefers not to start Anderson and Davis alongside each other, but they still share a fair amount of time on the court together. The Pelicans are back in action on Wednesday against the Kings, and if Davis is forced to miss another contest, Anderson is the obvious bet to earn another start in his place. During the last five games, he is averaging 15.6 points (33.8 FG, 27.3 3Pt, 86.4 FT) on 14.8 shots to go with 6.8 rebounds, one assist, one steal, and 0.6 blocks in 36 minutes per appearance.

He originally needed arthroscopic surgery in the offseason on the same knee which was the root of his current absence, but obviously things have taken a turn for the worse as he'll need further medical attention while Dante Cunningham, Alonzo Gee, Luke Babbitt, and Tyreke Evans continue seeing minutes at small forward.

          While Wednesday wasn't Davis' sharpest night from the field -- the 22-year-old missed 14 shots from the field and was held to just eight second half points -- he still came within striking distance of a triple-double. Davis, who's averaged 38.8 minutes played over his last six games, will enjoy a well-deserved night off Thursday before taking on the Pacers on Friday.

If he does end up returning, he'll likely remain somewhat restricted and isn't expected to establish a significant role in just his first game of the season.

With the nine assists he dished out Thursday, the seven-year veteran now has averaged 10 dimes over the last three games.

Additionally, the Pelicans are expected to lift his minutes restriction as soon as next week, meaning that Holiday could end up settling closer to 30 minutes per contest for what remains of the campaign.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/201936" class="ng-binding">Evans had an inefficient afternoon in the Pelicans' 94-88 loss to the Heat on Friday, finishing the contest with six points (2-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT), seven assists, six rebounds, and five turnovers across 35 minutes.</a></strong><br><br>
          The six points were the second fewest that Evans has scored since making his season debut on Dec. 1 following a knee procedure. He had been shooting the ball well in the Pelicans' previous two games, hitting 14-of-27 attempts, so fantasy owners probably shouldn't be overly concerned about the drop off in Evans' performance Friday. He still did well to get his rebounds and assists, and should continue to regularly challenge for triple-doubles while he approaches 35 minutes per contest.

          Cunningham has seen less than 10 minutes in three of the Pelicans' last four games, as the team's gradual return to full health has resulted in a steep reduction in his and Alonzo Gee's minutes. The duo will only see their playing time retreat further in January, when Quincy Pondexter, who started at small forward for 28 games in the regular season and all four of the Pelicans' postseason games in 2014-15, is expected to return from a knee injury.

          Babbitt has only appeared in two of the Pelicans' last eight games, seeing a total of 10 minutes during that time. He ranks behind Alonzo Gee and Dante Cunningham on the depth chart at small forward, and will see his playing time plunge further when Quincy Pondexter (knee) returns from injury, likely at some point in January.

          Ajinca had been held out of the Pelicans' previous three games while nursing a strained left calf, but he was deemed ready to go in advance of the Christmas Day tilt. Despite Ajinca's availability, coach Alvin Gentry opted not to use the 7-foot-2 Frenchman with the Heat playing a small-ball lineup for roughly half the game, as opposing center Hassan Whiteside played only 25 minutes. Though he's now healthy, it looks like Ajinca could be forced to settle for limited run most nights behind starting center Omer Asik and Anthony Davis.

          The extra period bumped his playing time up, but Gordon would have finished with his third straight game of at least 32 minutes even if the contest had concluded in regulation. Although it looked as though the returns of Tyreke Evans and Norris Cole could result in a decline in minutes for Gordon, the veteran shooting guard has thus far been able to stave off the duo from absorbing his court time. He's now notched double-digit scoring in five straight games and has knocked down 14 three-pointers during that span.

          He missed a shot at the end of regulation that would have won his Christmas  Day debut for the Pelicans, but otherwise Davis had another outstanding performance in recording his 10th double-double in 12 December games.

          He's heating up again from downtown, shooting 50 percent (8-for-16) from three-point range over the last three games.

          While this sounds like good news, Holiday is also expected to continue coming off the bench once that restriction is lifted, so it remains to be seen where he will settle in on a night-to-night basis. He has been between 21 and 29 minutes in each of the last five games. Norris Cole will also come off the bench behind Tyreke Evans and Holiday, following the departure of Ish Smith.

          It is unclear how much he will play on Christmas, but the Pelicans now have another usable body in the frontcourt. Ajinca was only averaging 12.8 minutes per game prior to the injury, so he has a very limited ceiling in daily leagues Friday.
