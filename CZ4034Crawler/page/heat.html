          Despite being left out of the starting five, Whiteside turned in another huge performance Monday. He was key in containing the Pacers down low and was able to his highest block total in five games. The absence of Chris Bosh (calf) has opened the court up a bit more for Whiteside to provide some offense, which he certainly has over the past two contests.

However, the Heat will bring Justice Winslow off the bench and start Green at the small forward position instead.

The shooting guard received good news over the weekend when an MRI on his knee came back negative, so if Wade can make it through pregame warmups without any renewed soreness, he should be cleared to rejoin the starting five and play around 30 minutes. Gerald Green would move back to he bench to accommodate Wade's return.

          Winslow replaced Chris Bosh (calf) in the starting five, as the Heat went with an undersized top unit that featured Luol Deng at power forward. Though the Heat haven't offered a formal timetable for Bosh's return, it seems likely that the 31-year-old could be looking at an extended absence after he recently began taking blood-thinning medication to combat the clotting he was experiencing in his calf. With both Bosh and Dwyane Wade (knee) banged up, Goran Dragic and Luol Deng will take on more extensive usage in the Heat's offensive attack, but Winslow should also benefit from a plenty of looks as a secondary option. Winslow's rebounding and defensive abilities remain his greatest skills, but the team's overall lack of health should still allow his point production to climb while he regularly sees 30-plus minutes.

However, if he keeps performing at this level, he'll likely remain a relevant part of the rotation even after Bosh is able to return given Bosh's ability to slide over and occupy the center position.

          Whiteside was assessed a flagrant-2 after he elbowed the Spurs' Boban Marjanovic trying to get possession of a rebound. This isn't the first time Whiteside has been down this road of trouble with the NBA, so a possible suspension could be looming. Whiteside did have a somewhat productive evening prior to the ejection, but he will definitely have to cool his jets going forward. This was the last game for the Heat before the All-Star break and it appears Whiteside's break could be a bit longer, but at least he'll be well rested when he returns.

          Bosh had a season-high seven turnovers in this game against the hounding Spurs' defense. He's usually very careful with the basketball, but this simply wasn't Bosh's night as he was matched up against LaMarcus Aldridge. Bosh is still one of the best power forwards in the game and this shouldn't deter you from playing him anytime soon. Keep rolling out Bosh in every single fantasy format, but in DFS, it would be wise to choose him in favorable matchups only.

          Wade wasn't able to put up as many shots as he usually does, and that's in large part to the Spurs' defense that the Heat faced on Tuesday. It was also the fourth time that D-Wade failed to record a rebound in a game this season. He did shoot the ball efficiently, but we shouldn't expect too many mediocre performances like this one going forward. Wade is still a safe play in every fantasy format.

Instead, the Heat plan to let Johnson recover at his own pace until he's 100 percent, and the team seems to be bracing for the possibility that he could be sidelined for the remainder of the regular season.

Amar'e Stoudemire is again listed as the starting center on the Heat's pregame notes, though that's subject to chance should Whiteside's condition improve over the next several hours.

          Johnson has been bothered on-and-off by the shoulder since his days at Fresno State, but he said he neglected to undergo surgery as he fought to establish himself as a rotation-caliber player in the NBA.

He'll now sit out until close to the end of the regular season, but the hope is that he'll be back at close to full strength by the time the postseason begins. In Johnson's absence, Miami will lean even more heavily on the Goran Dragic/Beno Udrih combination at point guard, while Gerald Green and Justise Winslow could each see minutes boosts.

The conflicting reports make it difficult to parse out exactly how limited Dragic will be Friday, but given that he has not played since Jan. 11, it's more likely than not that he plays less than his season average of 32.5 minutes.

          Dragic indicated on Monday that he wasn't targeting a return to action until Friday's game against the Bucks, and while that still could be the case, he's evidently shown enough improvement with his calf on some level for the Heat to consider using him Tuesday. Even if Dragic defies the odds and is cleared to play, don't expect him to see his usual 30 minutes of court time, as he's seen only limited activity since suffering the injury about two weeks ago.

          Whiteside has missed the last two games after suffering an oblique injury last week against the Wizards, and he'll sit out a third straight contest Tuesday. That means Amar'e Stoudemire is likely in for another start at center, while Chris Bosh should again see a large minutes load. Consider Whiteside questionable to return for Friday's game in Milwaukee.

          Udrih returned from a four-game absence and took back the reins of the top point guard job from Tyler Johnson, who settled back into his more comfortable backup role. Though Udrih wasn't particularly effective in his time on the court, the fact that he was merely back in action was a welcome development for the Heat, who were still without four players due to injury Monday. It's expected that Udrih will draw another start Tuesday against the Nets, but any window for extended minutes could slam shut as soon as Friday against the Bucks. Goran Dragic, who has missed the last seven games with a calf strain, is targeting a return for that contest, and his availability would result in Udrih assuming a low-minute bench role.

          Green has been hampered by right knee tendinitis for over a week and has more recently been dealing with a strained right oblique, but because neither injury is considered particularly serious, he's continue to play on for the Heat with several other players on the roster dealing with more problematic ailments. Even though he's been able to take the court, Green has still been abysmal over the last six games, averaging just four points on 19.6 percent shooting from the field and 15.8 percent shooting from beyond the three-point arc. Perhaps once Goran Dragic (calf) or Hassan Whiteside (oblique) return to action, Green can finally pick up some much-needed rest.

          Despite the returns of Luol Deng (eye) and Beno Udrih (neck), Winslow was still afforded a huge chunk of court time, and finished second on the team in minutes.

Though he's averaging a mere 3.8 points and 2.6 assists in 15.4 minutes over 24 games for the Heat this season, Udrih's return would represent a major boon for the backcourt, as the ongoing absence of Goran Dragic (calf), who is expected to miss at least two more games, has forced Tyler Johnson to log more minutes than desired at point guard.

          Green has been playing through tendinitis in his right knee the past several games and his availability is once again in question. In Friday's loss to the Raptors, Green missed all seven of his shot attempts and played only 22 minutes. He joins fellow guards Dwyane Wade (shoulder) and Beno Udrih (neck) as questionable, which means Tyler Johnson and Josh Richardson could see extra action on Monday night.

          Dragic has missed the past five games with a strained left calf but could return to the court Friday night. Fellow point guard Beno Udrih (neck) has also been listed as questionable so the Heat could be extremely thin at point guard, leaving Tyler Johnson as a likely replacement. An official decision could wait to be made until after pregame warmups.

          Whiteside's injury was initially classified as an oblique strain, but coach Erik Spoelstra labeled the ailment as either a hip contusion or a hip strain after the game. The Heat's medical staff should have a clearer idea at the extent of the injury before Friday's game against the Raptors, but until then, it's difficult to count on Whiteside being available for that contest. In addition to Whiteside, the Heat also lost Luol Deng (eye) to injury during the game, and entered the night without Dwyane Wade (shoulder), Goran Dragic (calf), Beno Udrih (neck), Chris Andersen (knee), and Josh McRoberts (knee). A potential Whiteside absence for Friday's game would likely result in Amar'e Stoudemire making his first start of the season.

          The Heat finished the night with just eight healthy players, resulting in Winslow seeing 10 minutes more than his average for the season. None of the seven injured players are sure bets to play in Friday's game against the Raptors, and if that's the case, Winslow would likely enter the starting lineup at small forward and be asked to take on a greater offensive burden alongside Chris Bosh.

          It was clear that Miami struggled with guards Goran Dragic, Beno Udrih and Dwyane Wade all sidelined with injuries, which didn't help Bosh's game.

Until Udrih and/or Dragic are cleared, though, Tyler Johnson will continue to serve as the Heat's No. 1 point guard.

          There was never much doubt that Green would be active for the contest, as the Heat listed him as probable on Monday's injury report with right knee tendinitis. With four players set to miss Tuesday's game for injury-related reasons, Green could end up taking on an increased role in the Heat's offensive attack.

          Stokes was listed as probable for Tuesday's game as of Monday, so this is merely confirmation that he'll be available off the bench. Only 11 players are set to dress for Tuesday's contest, so Stokes could end up making a rare appearance for the Heat, though he likely wouldn't receive very many minutes.

          Wade was initially deemed a game-time call, but after undergoing an MRI with the results returning negative, the veteran told reporters that he'll take the court Tuesday night. Wade sat out Friday's win over Denver to rest his shoulders, but he returned Sunday in Oklahoma City, finishing with 22 points in the 99-74 defeat. With both Beno Udrih and Goran Dragic sidelined for Miami on Tuesday, expect Wade to act as the primary ball-handler for much of the game.

          Despite dealing with soreness in both shoulders, Wade is considered probable for Tuesday's game against the Bucks after playing 29 minutes in Sunday's loss to the Thunder. His status should still be monitored, as the Heat could decide to give him the night off if the MRI reveals anything problematic.

          McRoberts hasn't played in well over a month and he remains without a concrete timetable to return. The Heat seem content to evaluate him on a game-to-game basis, though all indications are that he has not been particularly close to returning at any point in the last five weeks. McRoberts has not played since Dec. 9.

          A case of right knee tendinitis limited Green to just 12 minutes in Sunday's game against the Thunder, with which he provided three points (1-7 FG, 1-3 3Pt) and one rebound. Green's probable designation suggests the injury won't be a major issue going forward, so he figures to see a much healthier dose of minutes Tuesday, especially with all of Goran Dragic (calf), Beno Udrih (neck), Josh McRoberts (knee), and Chris Andersen (knee) already ruled out of the contest.
