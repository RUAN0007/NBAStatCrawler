          The weight of Chicago's offensive production will fall on Rose's shoulders for the time being, as a knee injury has sidelined Jimmy Butler for a multiple-week stretch.

Additionally, Gasol prefers to stay and sign a long-term deal in Chicago, which has some teams worried he won't be motivated after a trade.

          Butler suffered a scary knee injury Friday that has fortunately only been diagnosed as a knee sprain for now. There is currently no timetable for his return, but it would likely be safe to assume he will not return until after the All Star break. However, that is just speculation at this point. In his absence E'Twaun Moore, Tony Snell, and Doug McDermott should see increased usage in the team's offense. Derrick Rose will likely need to take on a bigger role offensively as well.

          The veteran power forward saw an uptick in production with frontcourt mate Pau Gasol sitting out the contest with a hand injury. Gibson provided his typical outstanding work on the glass and on defense, tallying a trio of stuffs for the second time in three February contests. Gibson's scoring total was also a season high, as were the shot attempts.

It was a second consecutive double-digit scoring game for McDermott, after having only accomplished the feat four times in the 17 contests prior. His minutes have steadied nicely since early January as well, and he's already averaging 23 per game in three February outings. With his accurate shooting touch--particularly from behind the arc---and solid work on the glass, McDermott offers respectable production in deep season-long formats and as a cost-effective option in daily leagues.

          Rose once again was forced to shoulder greater offensive responsibility, with Pau Gasol sitting out the game and backcourt mate Jimmy Butler being wheeled off the court late in the first half with a knee injury. The veteran was up to the task, amassing a near triple-double while taking the most shot attempts he has all season in an non-overtime contest and racking up his second-best scoring tally on the campaign. Primarily due to Butler's absence for a combined six quarters-plus over the last two games, Rose is already averaging a robust 21 shot attempts per game in three February contests, over six more per game than his previous high-water mark of 15.7 in January. He's also been outstanding with his ball distribution over the last two contests in particular, totaling 17 dimes over that span. If Butler is forced to miss any appreciable amount of time, Rose appears capable of boosting his overall production across all categories while shouldering the additional load, provided his own often-delicate health remains intact.

          Despite Monday being the second game of a back-to-back, Butler played 47 minutes. Sunday's game against the Clippers was the fourth time this season that he has failed to dish an assist.

          Portis has become more of a fixture in the rotation since Joakim Noah went down with a likely season-ending shoulder injury, but his playing time has still fluctuated over the last five games, as he's seen between seven and 22 minutes in those contests.

          Butler was able to set a personal milestone by recording his 4,000th career point on his first bucket of the contest, but beyond that, it was a very substandard showing for the Bulls star.

Rose is also noticeably making an effort to get to the basket more, as he has attempted just one three-pointer over his last four games.

          Butler missed shootaround earlier in the day due to illness, but his status never really appeared to be in much jeopardy. The Marquette product may not be at full strength, but he's not expected to see a reduced role, though his effectiveness may be impacted by the ailment. Butler enters Friday averaging 26.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 6.3 assists per game in the month of January.

          Butler missed shootaround Friday morning with an illness, but the Bulls still expect him to play Friday night and have officially listed him as probable. With that being said, expect him to remain in the starting lineup and see his normal allotment of minutes barring any setbacks with the illness.

Joakim Noah (shoulder) being out for the season will likely result in a decent role for Portis going forward, but it remains to be seen how consistently rookie coach Fred Holberg will rely on his rookie forward to play meaningful minutes.

Given Noah's relative ineffectiveness this season and lengthy injury history, it seems rather likely that his season is over, though there's still a chance he could return late in the year or sometime during the postseason. "Hopefully we’ll get to see him here soon," Jimmy Butler said. "He’s still going to be joking around even though he won’t be playing with us. That’s big."

However, he was able to return following that one-game absence on Friday. Rose provided his predictably inefficient scoring, but on the positive side of things, he committed only one turnover. Still, the Bulls' offense struggled badly overall, and as a result the team lost a low-scoring battle to the Mavericks.

          Hinrich started the last three games, but with Derrick Rose back in the lineup, Hinrich will return to his normal bench role. Hinrich's playing time should decrease with this move, and he likely won't see extensive minutes unless Rose succumbs to another injury.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/201565" class="ng-binding">Rose (knee) is expected to take the court in Tuesday's matchup with the Bucks, Nick Friedell of ESPN Chicago reports.</a></strong><br><br>
          Rose has missed the last three games due to soreness in both his hamstring and knee. He went through shootaround Tuesday and participated in warmups without any issues, so coach Fred Hoiberg now says he expects Rose to play. Look for Rose to assume the starting point guard responsibilities, but he could see limited minutes if the injuries act up at all. With Rose back in the lineup, Kirk Hinrich and Aaron Brooks could see a slight decrease in their minutes.

          Head coach Fred Hoiberg sounded optimistic when discussing the possibility of Rose playing on Tuesday. The Bulls will wait to see how Rose does in pregame warmups, looking to make sure he doesn't suffer a setback or have some soreness before tip. The former MVP has missed the past three games due to soreness in his right hamstring and knee.

          Noah continues to rehab a slight tear in his left shoulder, which he sustained back on Dec. 21 against the Nets. Coach Fred Hoiberg commented Monday that Noah has not been cleared to return to practice, so it's almost a certainty that the big man will sit out Tuesday's matchup with the Bucks. However, the Bulls have ruled out surgery as an option, so Noah should remain on a two-to-four week timetable. Hoiberg indicated that Noah will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis going forward, implying that his recovery is going as planned.
