          With Anderson enduring no setbacks with his left ankle in Monday's session, the 33-year-old indicated that he's "hopeful" to make his team debut Tuesday against the Pelicans, according to CSN Mid-Atlantic's Peter Hailey. The small forward, who has missed all 54 of the Wizards' games to date following October surgery on the ankle, said he'll face no restrictions when he is finally cleared to play again, J. Michael of CSN Mid-Atlantic reports.

          Heading into last week, the Wizards expressed optimism that Anderson, who has been out all season while recovering from two ankle operations, would be able to enter the fray for at least one game of their three consecutive tilts on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, but the team instead opted to hold him out of all of those contests. Fortunately for the 33-year-old, it doesn't sound like a setback in his recovery influenced the team's decision to keep him sidelined; instead, it appears the Wizards simply wanted him to go through one more practice before making his debut. He's scheduled to partake in Monday's session, and if all goes well, the Wizards should clarify whether Anderson will play on Tuesday or Wednesday. Expect him to see a limited role while coming off the bench.

This was the third game in three nights for the Wizards and they faced a tough opponent so there's no reason to harp on this performance. Beal is still productive, whether he's starting or coming off the bench, but it might be a while before we see him return to his old ways when he was posting outrageous numbers across the board.

The great thing about Dudley is that he can chip away at a number of different categories, and with the fast pace the Wizards play at, he gives you more opportunities to notch those stats. For now, Dudley is still in the starting lineup, but at some point, it wouldn't be a surprise to see Morris take that role over. Continue ahead with Dudley for the time being, but just know this fun ride may have an expiration date.

          Beal made seven of his 10 attempts from the field on Friday, and helped Washington earn its second victory in as many days. The win was especially important since the Pistons and Wizards are now tied in the loss column, and Beal will do all he can going forward to lead a late charge for the playoffs.

          Wall got his team off to a great start in the first game after the All-Star break, but the sledding certainly doesn't get any easier for the Wizards.

In season-long leagues, you should feel blessed that you get seven games of Wall in the next 11 days, but hopefully he doesn't break down due to exhaustion.

          Garrett Temple will draw the start for Washington's first game after the All-Star break Thursday, but Beal will be available off the bench. Castillo reported earlier in the week that Beal could have his minutes monitored right out of the break given that the Wizards are embarking on a back-to-back-to-back set starting Thursday. In games where Beal comes off the bench, he's averaging 15.7 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 2.4 assists over 23.4 minutes.

          Morris is arguably the most talented player on the move as the deadline approaches, but he's battled issues both off and on the court over the last year. The Kansas product started all 82 games in 2014-15, averaging 15.3 points and 6.2 rebounds per game, but he was involved in an assault case over the summer and clashed with Suns management after the team traded his brother, Marcus, to the Pistons prior to the season. As a result, Morris has been in and out of the rotation in 2015-16, and the Wizards will gamble that a change of scenery will bring out the best in the 26-year-old. Morris may not be inserted into the starting lineup, but considering the Wizards gave up a first-round pick for his services, Morris figures to be a key piece as the team pushes toward a postseason berth.

          Shortly before the All-Star break, Beal returned to the starting lineup and played more than 30 minutes in the last two games, so it appears most of the earlier restrictions he faced upon coming back from a stress reaction in his right leg have since been lifted. However, because of the unique situation that three games in three days presents, the Wizards could still choose to rest Beal for at least one of the contests in order to avoid overworking him. If the Wizards throw caution into the wind and elect to play Beal all three games, he'd likely see his court time capped to some extent.

There was mention earlier Wednesday that Anderson could make his season debut this week, and the fact that he practiced Wednesday certainly backs up that statement. The Wizards begin the second half of their schedule with a brutal back-to-back-to-back set, so Anderson's impending return would give the team another depth option on the perimeter.

          This comes as somewhat of a surprise, as Anderson was still thought to be without a timetable prior to All-Star Weekend. However, the 33-year-old, who underwent two ankle operations in the offseason, has increased his activity of late, and there's a chance he could return as soon as later this week. Washington is coming up on a unique part of its schedule with three games in three nights beginning Thursday against the Jazz. Anderson should be considered questionable for that contest, as the team will only have one day of organized practice beforehand. The 6-6 Anderson will likely be limited for a handful of games after making his debut as he works his way back into game shape.

With the Wizards playing from behind most of the game, they had to run a little more up-tempo than usual which hurt Gortat's usage. He'll continue to be a fine play moving forward in season-long leagues but it's best to use him only in favorable matchups for DFS.

While an injury is never a good thing, it probably couldn't have come at a better time for him, with the All-Star break up next.

The former number-one overall pick has also been locked in from 3-point range, as he's been 8-for-12 from beyond the arc in the last three games. The next matchup for Wall and the Wizards is on Tuesday against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden.

          Saturday represents the second night of a back-to-back, and Beal played 32 minutes Friday, so it would not be surprising if the Wizards' medical staff recommends fewer minutes for the shooting guard Saturday. This makes him a risky play in daily leagues. Garrett Temple will get the start at the two, but he also has limited upside Saturday.

          Beal exited the game Monday after 9 minutes of action. He posted four points, one rebound, one assist, one steal, and three turnovers during that time. The severity of his facial injury is unknown, but it is obviously not a good sign that he cannot return to the game. The Wizards next play Tuesday against the Raptors, expect an update on Beal's status when more information becomes available.

          Gooden continues to spend the majority of his season on the Wizards' bench, only taking the court 12 times this season, with six of those opportunities coming in January. He joins Otto Porter (hip) and Kris Humphries (knee) on the bench, leaving only Nene Hilario and DeJuan Blair as available front court reserves. He'll continue to nurse his sore right calf, with his next chance to return to the court coming on Wednesday.

          The original plan by the Wizards called for Beal to sit out Saturday rather than play on consecutive nights so soon after returning from his leg injury, but given how good he looked Friday they may have to give the idea some more thought. He'll remain on a minutes restriction for a couple of weeks yet whether he plays or not Saturday, though, so despite Friday's production, in shallower fantasy formats you may want to be patient and wait for him to start getting something closer to starter's minutes on a regular basis before you pop Beal back onto your active roster.

Beal ended up receiving 23 minutes off the bench Wednesday and should see his court time rise slightly in the games to follow, but given that the Wizards view the young shooting guard as a long-term cog in their organization, it's quite likely that his days of regularly logging 35-to-40 minutes like he was prior the injury are over -- at least for this season.

          Hilario sat out Saturday with his right triceps strain, but apparently a one-game absence is all that was needed. He recently came off a long absence with a calf issue and played 12 and 13 minutes since returning, and that same portion of minutes is expected Monday yet again.

          Humphries hasn't resumed on-court workouts with the Wizards since sustaining the knee injury last week, and looks on track to miss a fourth straight contest. The Wizards could surely use his services with the likes of Marcin Gortat (knee), Nene Hilario (triceps), and DeJuan Blair (knee) all uncertain to play, leaving the team's frontcourt perilously thin.

          Hilario missed Saturday's win over the Magic after straining his triceps. If he does play tonight, it will likely be in a limited role. The center can't seem to catch a break, as he just returned from a calf injury that kept him out for over a month, only playing in two games before suffering the triceps injury. An official decision about his status for Monday may be held off until he goes through pregame warmups.

          If Gortat does play, it will most likely be in a limited role. He appears to have a large lump on his left knee that is prohibiting him from even bending it. Gortat will likely see how he feels during pregame warmups and then make a decision. If he can't play, Drew Gooden could get the start.
