When he was healthy, the defensive-minded Hollis-Jefferson was one of the few bright spots in a dismal season for the Nets, so he should be in line for an enhanced role in the team's rotation once he's cleared to play again.

If he can avoid any setbacks with his knee the rest of the way, the 21-year-old could become one of the Nets' top players off the bench, as the reserve frontcourt crew of Thomas Robinson, Willie Reed, and Andrea Bargnani has been mostly devoid of production all season.

          Johnson has been on fire these last two games, but this was a great matchup in which he took full advantage of. Friday marked a night of season-highs  across the board for Johnson. In addition to the 27 points, his 11 assists and five 3-pointers set new marks as well. In the last two contests, he's tallied 20 assists and nine 3-pointers. Johnson has another fine opportunity ahead of him on Saturday, as the Nets take on the Sixers.

          Johnson is certainly on the back-nine of his career, but every now and again, you'll see him come up with a performance like the one he had on Wednesday. Since the moment has passed, "January Joe" can no longer live up to his timely moniker and it doesn't seem like more 20-point outings like this one are on the horizon. However, the Nets take on the Kings in their next game and that is a very favorable matchup for the aging Johnson.

          Sloan did just enough again to keep the edge in this comical point guard battle for the Nets. In all honesty, the competition in which Sloan and his teammate Shane Larkin are emersed in is more of an audition for next year's backup point guard role. Look for this see-saw affair to continue throughout the entirety of the season, with neither emerging unless an injury or major dip in production occurs. For now, Sloan seems to have the upper hand, but that is not the most ringing endorsement in terms of fantasy hopefulness.

          Lopez is on a major heater right now and it would be wise to make sure you have a piece of him in every fantasy format. Ever since Jarrett Jack went down with a season-ending injury, the Nets have been trying to find each and every way to make him the focal point of their offense. In the DFS game, Lopez was always better served in favorable matchups, but now, it's getting to the point where he's on the borderline of being matchup-proof. Lopez's next contest is against DeMarcus Cousins and the Kings, where he'll certainly have his hands full at both ends of the court.

His shooting percentage has dipped significantly since the start of November, but that could be a function of the increased number of shots he has attempted as he assumes a larger offensive role. Young should continue to play a big part at both ends of the court for the lowly Nets, and he is easily on pace to set a new career-high in rebounding.

          For the third straight game, the Nets rolled with a different starting shooting guard, as Wayne Ellington replaced Brown, who had previously replaced Bojan Bogdanovic. None of those three players have been particularly good lately, but for what it's worth, Brown appears to rank at the bottom of the pecking order among the trio. Both Ellington (29 minutes) and Bogdanovic (21 minutes) each saw considerably more playing time than Brown on Monday.

However, he hardly provided anything in the form of meaningful production, which has largely been the case throughout the season. Ellington's top skill is his ability to hit three-point shots, but he's only hitting on 32.4 percent of his attempts from distance this season. The fact that Ellington is starting in spite of those struggles speaks to the lack of attractive options the Nets have available at shooting guard.

It's unclear if the move will be permanent, though with Jack lost for the season, the Nets' roster isn't exactly overflowing with attractive replacement options.

          Larkin is averaging a modest 6.8 points, 3.8 assists, and 2.2 boards over 19.1 minutes per contest this season, but the removal of Jack from the picture leaves about 30 extra minutes up for grabs in the Nets backcourt. A large portion of that playing time is expected to go to Larkin, who profiles as a better option at point guard than Donald Sloan or Markel Brown, neither of whom have been consistent rotation options this season. The added minutes should enable Larkin to emerge as a more regular double-digit scoring threat, but his overall ceiling remains a bit limited due to his underdeveloped offensive game.

The 32-year-old will now face a long road to recovery from the injury, and his absence for the rest of the season will further weaken what was already one of the league's worst rosters. Shane Larkin is expected to slide into the starting lineup and should be the main beneficiary for minutes at point guard, while Donald Sloan could also see some more extensive run off the bench. We'll have to wait and see for sure what coach Lionel Hollins plans to do following the unfortunate news regarding Jack's injury.

          The durable Lopez played a combined 75 minutes between Sunday and Monday, scoring at least 20 in each game. A consistent source of fantasy production, Lopez embraces significant court time while putting up big numbers in points, rebounds, and blocks. The only question seems to be whether he'll finish the season with the 8-20 Nets.

          This will be Larkin's fourth consecutive missed game, as he continues to deal with the after-effects of a concussion. In his absence, Jarrett Jack, Donald Sloan, and Markel Brown have seen increased roles at the guard position, and that trend should continue Monday in Chicago.

          Bargnani (hamstring) was questionable to play entering Thursday. The 30-year-old center would reward team head coach Lionel Hollins with a season-high 23 points, even adding six rebounds- a rare feat for the offensive-minded big man. Bargnani's progress is likely only worth tracking for deeper leagues; the Italian center is unlikely to receive substantial minutes ahead of Brook Lopez and Thaddeus Young.

          After seeing his playing time tail off a bit in recent weeks, Jack has seen 37 minutes in both of the last two games, suggesting that he's not about to lose out on run to backup Shane Larkin. Jack is averaging 31.8 minutes per game on the season, which is a bit less than was projected heading into the season given the Nets' meager depth, but he's still produced roughly as anticipated. He's submitted averages of 13.2 points (on 40.1 percent shooting), 6.8 assists, 4.3 boards, 0.9 steals, and one three-pointer.

          The 22 points also tied a season high for Johnson, who may have been forced to go over the 40-minute mark as a byproduct of Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (ankle) sitting out. Hollis-Jefferson will likely be sidelined through the All-Star break, and while Bojan Bogdanovic figures to pick up most of his minutes, the breakout rookie's absence may create more opportunities for Johnson to stay on the floor as a result of his ability to play both wing spots. Johnson is already seeing 35 minutes per game on the season, but is averaging a paltry 11.5 points thanks to a career-low 36.6 percent shooting mark from the field and 28.6 percent showing from beyond the three-point line.

Larkin had been over 21 minutes in each of the previous four games, however, so it's possible that Tuesday's disappointing showing was just a blip on the radar. Larkin should still be viewed as one of the top reserves on a dreadful Nets second unit.

While he's unlikely to regularly see as hefty of a load of minutes as he did Tuesday, the 6-foot-8 swingman doesn't have much competition behind him, as Wayne Ellington, Sergey Karasev, and Markel Brown are best suited for low-usage reserve roles.

          Young has now posted a double-double in eight of his past 11 contests, and continues to be a quality source for scoring and rebounding at the forward position.

Throughout his career the 32-year-old has never been able to hold up as a starter, though, and he hasn't started more than 39 games in a season since the 2009-2010 season, so if you'd been relying on Jack's distribution on your roster, make sure you have a contingency plan.

          He had been out all season after tearing the UCL in his right thumb during the preseason. While Reed is active Saturday, he is not a lock to see much action, and it would be best to take a wait and see approach in fantasy leagues.

          Hollis-Jefferson notched his second double-double in three games, and he's slowly starting to see a consistent role on the Nets. He's now averaging 9.0 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 2.0 steals over the last five games. While those numbers don't pop off the box score, he's still worth a speculative add in deeper formats.

          Bargnani has now put up two consecutive double-digit scoring outings, but hasn't shown enough consistency this season to be worth thinking about from a fantasy perspective. He's limited to a bench role playing under 15 minutes a game, and adding insult to injury is the fact that he's historically struggled to stay healthy. In other words, in spite of his recent uptick in scoring, he can be safely ignored from a fantasy perspective.

          Hollis-Jefferson provided an awfully well-rounded showing on Sunday after delivering a double-double in Friday's loss to the Celtics. Either he just likes playing versus the Celtics, or this is a sign of things to come. The Nets don't have much young talent on their roster, so Hollis-Jefferson is likely going to continue earning all the opportunities he can handle over the course of the season.

          Lopez now has seven double-doubles on the season, and his status as the team's first option offensively is unquestioned.
