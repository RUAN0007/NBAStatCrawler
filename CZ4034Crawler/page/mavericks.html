          Following Saturday's practice, the Mavericks relayed that Williams was nursing an ankle injury, but the injury's subsequent reclassification as a calf ailment may give the team a little more pause about the point guard's health. Williams was previously slowed by calf problems in training camp, though that injury pertained to his other calf.

          The 18-year veteran was one of the few Mavericks players who seemed to show up, with Dallas finding themselves in a 62-26 hole by halftime. Nowitzki near double-doubled during his modest time on the court, before being pulled along with the first unit once things were hopelessly out of reach. The veteran, along with the rest of his teammates, should be able to dust themselves off from the Spurs' ambush and return to their typical level of production.

          The fact that the 11-year reserve led Dallas in scoring is indicative of the type of night it was for the Mavericks. It was the Villanueva's first double-digit scoring output since Jan. 20 against the Timberwolves, and his ninth overall on the season. While Friday's production was certainly solid, Villanueva's opportunities to reach even modest scoring totals only typically come about as a result of injury to others in front of him, or in the second half of severe blowouts.

          The Mavericks have been resting Nowitzki during back-to-back games recently and that will be the case again Sunday, as the team takes on the Suns in the first of back-to-back games. With that being said, he should return to the starting lineup come Monday's outing versus the Hawks. When Nowitzki was out on Wednesday, the Mavericks used a small-ball lineup and started the likes of Deron Williams, Raymond Felton, Weslety Matthews, Chandler Parsons and Salah Mejri. They could go with a similar plan of action Sunday, although they may opt to instead use Dwight Powell or Charlie Villanueva at power forward.

          After seeing 31 minutes per game in December, Felton is back down at 25 minutes per contest in January--the same total he was earning in November.

          Williams had averaged 18 points on 46.8 percent shooting from the field in the previous three games, so fantasy owners should be willing to overlook the veteran's terrible day from the field.

McGee's lack of usage likely also had a lot to do with the Rockets rolling out a small-ball lineup while Dwight Howard (ankle) remained sidelined.

The latter could miss another game or two because of the present injuries to his right leg, giving Mejri a shot at some short-term fantasy value, but he should return to a bench role in short order.

          Pachulia has been struggling from the field lately, scoring 8.3 points on 37 percent shooting over the last four games. However, he is hauling in 12 rebounds per game over that stretch to go along with 2.5 assists, 0.5 steals, and 0.3 blocks in 31 minutes per contest--counting stats that make the soon-to-be 32-year-old center a worthy contributor across all scoring formats.

          Williams is posting 15.5 points, 6.3 assists to 2.8 turnovers, 3.8 rebounds, one block, and 0.3 steals in 35 minutes per night over the last four games. The 31-year-old guard receives the occasional night to rest here and there as part of coach Rick Carlisle's plan to keep his veterans fresh over the course of the season. Still, Williams makes for a rather reliable fantasy option this season when he does in fact suit up.

          The four points were Nowitzki's fewest since Feb. 29, 2012, when he was held to one point over nine minutes in a game against the Grizzlies. Nowitzki and several other Mavericks starters have been rested for the second half of both of the team's last two back-to-back sets, but given the low minutes total he received Sunday, he'll likely be back in the starting lineup for Monday's tilt with the Celtics.
