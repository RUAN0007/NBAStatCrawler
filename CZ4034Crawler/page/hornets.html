          Lin bounced back from a one-for-eight dud on Friday in Milwaukee to help the Hornets win its fifth straight game. The swap of P.J. Hairston for Courtney Lee could mean a few less minutes for Lin going forward, but Michael Kidd-GIlchrist (shoulder) being out for the season means that Lee and Jeremy Lamb may be likely to spend some time at small forward. Over the last five contests, Lin is posting 7.6 points on only 33 percent shooting to go with 2.6 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 1.6 steals, and 0.8 blocks in 25 minutes per appearance.

          Batum committed four turnovers, but still had an efficient game regardless, albeit against the lowly Nets.

          Jefferson has seen a combined 47 minutes in his first two games back from a torn meniscus. He is coming off the bench behind Cody Zeller, and it's unclear whether Jefferson will return to the starting lineup eventually. However, the important thing is that he is pain-free, and he will likely have better luck scoring against backups at this stage in his career anyways. Nevertheless, dominant displays like this probably shouldn't be expected all that often from the 31-year-old big man.

In the process, Charlotte has catapulted itself from ninth to seventh in the East, and sits three games above .500 for the first time in 2016 after a seven-game losing steak knocked the team off course from Dec. 30 to Jan. 10.

          Kidd-Gilchrist had reclaimed his spot in the starting five after making his season debut in late January following his recovery from right shoulder surgery, but the fourth-year forward's return lasted just seven games before he tore the labrum of the same shoulder Feb. 10 against the Pacers. With Kidd-Gilchrist expected to undergo another procedure that will more than likely end his season, Hairston should be the biggest beneficiary, as he had started most of the games in place of Kidd-Gilchrist earlier in the season. If he does indeed earn the spot with the top unit, Hairston won't necessarily be in line for a huge role, as he had played just two total minutes in the past three games. Reserve players Jeremy Lamb and Jeremy Lin could both still outpace Hairston for court time.

          Hawes had seen 25 minutes or more in the Hornets' preceding seven games, but the downturn in playing time over the past five contests has coincided with Cody Zeller's return from a shoulder injury. The path to playing time will only grow more difficult for Hawes when Al Jefferson (knee) returns shortly after the All-Star break.

The Hornets' frontcourt will only get more crowded once Al Jefferson (knee) is back in the fold in the second half, which will likely limit Hansbrough's appearances to mop-up duty in blowout contests.

          It's a tough break for Kidd-Gilchrist, who suffered the same injury during the preseason and was sidelined for nearly four months before making his season debut in late January. Given that Kidd-Gilchrist was initially projected to miss up to six months with that injury, it appears safe to assume that the small forward will be sidelined for the remainder of the season, even if he progresses in a similarly quick manner this time around. The team will re-evaluate Kidd-Gilchrist after the All-Star break before outlining a more definitive timetable for his return. Look for P.J. Hairston to return to the starting five in Kidd-Gilchrist's place, while bench wings such as Jeremy Lamb and Jeremy Lin could also see their roles increase.

          Kidd-Gilchrist dislocated his right shoulder in Wednesday's 117-95 win over the Pacers, but the severity of the ailment won't be known until the results of the MRI are made available. The 22-year-old, who is averaging 12.7 points and 6.4 rebounds over 29.3 minutes, was making just his seventh appearance of the season Wednesday after returning from a lengthy absence due to a torn labrum in that same right shoulder. Even if Kidd-Gilchrist doesn't require surgery to address this latest setback, it's fair to speculate that he'll be sidelined for at least a few weeks due to the injury, making him a drop candidate in most shallower formats. P.J. Hairston and Jeremy Lamb are likely to take on increased roles in the Hornets' rotation for the duration of Kidd-Gilchrist's absence.

          Jefferson is days away from reaching the projected six-week recovery timetable he was given following his Dec. 31 surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee, and while he could need some additional time beyond that to heal up, it doesn't appear as though he's hit any major snags in the rehabilitation process. The big man has also missed time this season due to a strained left calf and a five-game suspension, and only saw 15 and 18 minutes, respectively, in his two contests before suffering the knee injury, so he might not make for the most attractive stash option in shallower formats. However, his contributions as a scorer, rebounder, and shot blocker -- even in a limited capacity -- could make worth a look in most other formats if he's still in the wire.

          Walker's left knee soreness was enough to keep him sidelined for Wednesday's win over the Cavaliers, and he could be held out of Friday's contest as well. If Walker is forced to miss his second game of the season due to injury, Jeremy Lin figures to be in line for ball-handling duties once again. Fantasy owners should continue to monitor the situation until more information regarding Walker's status is released on Friday.

Assuming Batum takes the court, he'd likely claim his usual role at shooting guard, with Jeremy Lin the leading candidate to join him in the backcourt at point guard as a replacement for the injured Kemba Walker (knee). However, it's certainly possible that Batum, who's missed four of the last six contests, could end up being limited, so it would not be a surprise if P.J.

          The four-year pro got some extended time in the blowout loss, equaling a season high in minutes and putting them to good use. Roberts' season-best scoring total marked his second consecutive game with double-digit points, and only the third time overall he'd accomplished the feat this season. All three instances have occurred within the last five games, coinciding with the 30-year-old's first extended stretch of consistent, albeit modest, playing time. Whether this pattern will persist remains to be seen, but Roberts has proven capable of piling up the points in past opportunities.

          The veteran big man put his wide array of talents on display Friday, making his presence felt on the glass as usual but also showing off his deft shooting touch from the perimeter by draining four three-pointers. The treys equaled his second-best total of the season and were the most since he'd also sunk four against the Heat back on Dec. 9. With the Hornets' frontcourt still in depleted condition, Wiliams has played 33 minutes or more in four out of the last five contests, during which he's eclipsed 20 points and posted double-digit rebounds twice. Even with Cody Zeller's imminent return, Williams should continue to see a generous workload in the immediate future.

          The four-year pro wasted no time getting right back into the swing of things after offseason shoulder surgery, playing a robust 34 minutes and turning in both a productive and mistake-free performance. Kidd-Gilchrist did not commit any turnovers or get whistled for any personal fouls, a notable feat considering the amount of rust he was trying to shake off. He appeared fully capable of handling the full workload he took on, meaning he should receive plenty of opportunity to build on Friday's effort in the coming days. While fantasy owners will need to see him string several successful performances together to be convinced, the 22-year-old could hardly have made a better first impression considering his surprisingly early return from this injury.

Hansbrough set season highs across the stat sheet, with his scoring total largely boosted by his 10 visits to the charity stripe. The seven-year veteran's boost in playing time has been directly tied in to the depleted condition of the Hornets' frontcourt, but he could well be reduced to an array of single-digit allotments or DNPs once the likes of Cody Zeller (shoulder) and Al Jefferson (knee) return to full health.

          Not only did Kaminsky suffer through one of his worst shooting nights of the season, but he also provided little in the way of support defensively against DeMarcus Cousins, who erupted for a career-high 56 points while shooting an unconscious 21-for-30 from the field.

          Daniels not only scored a career-high 28 points on a career-high eight triples.

Daniels was buried on the Hornets' bench during October, November, and December, but he is starting to earn more meaningful minutes in January. He has scored in double figures in three of the last four games, but once Nicolas Batum (toe) is able to return, Daniels' time will again be fairly hard to come by.

          Kaminsky's fantasy value was already on the ascent heading into the contest, and it took another step up when he supplied another nice stat line while fellow big man Cody Zeller was forced to leave with a strained right shoulder.

          Kidd-Gilchrist, who underwent surgery in October to address a torn labrum in his right shoulder, appears to be well ahead of the six-month recovery timetable that he was handed down. That timetable would have put Kidd-Gilchrist on course to return with only a few games remaining in the season, but the fact that he's already being cleared for non-contact work suggests there's now a better chance that he could make his debut much earlier in the second half. At best, Kidd-Gilchrist is still likely several weeks away from getting back on the court, so it's probably too early to consider stashing him in most formats. Once he's fully healthy and cleared to return to the court, Kidd-Gilchrist will likely displace P.J. Hairston in the starting five, giving the Hornets stronger defense on the perimeter.

The absence of Al Jefferson (knee) continues to afford Kaminsky plenty of time off the bench, but the rookie's struggles from the field and modest contributions on the defensive end have limited his impact of late.

          Hawes was thought to be available for the Hornets' last game Saturday, but he did not play in that game, and it's not yet clear if he will be able to play in Charlotte's next game either. The Hornets will provide another update on Hawes' status sometime prior to Monday's tip-off.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/202391" class="ng-binding">Lin is listed as questionable for Monday's game against the Warriors due to lower back tightness.</a></strong><br><br>
          Lin played 34 minutes in the Hornets' last game Saturday after missing the previous two contests with the sprained right ankle, but it appears he is still dealing with some soreness. The Hornets will likely make a call on Lin's status at some point close to tip-off.

          After missing four games with the ailing back, Hawes will return to his reserve role for the Hornets going forward. He is not a great option season-long leagues, and is only useful in daily leagues when the frontcourt is extremely shorthanded.

          He ill get the start at shooting guard Saturday, and with Nicolas Batum out with a toe injury, there should be plenty of minutes available, making him an intriguing play in daily leagues.

          This means that P.J. Hairston will start at the three and have the unfortunate task of guarding Kevin Durant, while Jeremy Lin will start at the two if he is cleared to return from an ankle injury. Consider Batum questionable for Monday's game in Golden State.

          It sounds like Lin will just need to make it through pregame warmups and then he will be cleared to get the start. Nicolas Batum is out with a toe injury, so Lin could see around 30 minutes if he gets the nod.

          If he sits for a fifth straight game that will mean Cody Zeller and Frank Kaminsky will continue to see big minutes in the frontcourt.
