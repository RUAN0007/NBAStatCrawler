Green is known for his ability to hit shots from beyond the arc and play solid defense, but the Spurs spread the ball around so much that it's tough to rely on his production in standard leagues.

The promising second-year pro was much more aggressive with his shot, and wasn't lacking on the defensive end either.

          The Spurs welcomed back Tim Duncan (knee) in their final game before the All-Star break on Feb. 10 against the Magic, which should result in Diaw seeing his court time regularly fall into the 16-to-20-minute range rather than the 20-to-25-minute range in the second half. Diaw is a valuable reserve who created matchup issues for opposing bigs due to his passing and three-point shooting abilities, but because he typically doesn't receive a high volume of shot attempts, he rarely supplies useful fantasy lines.

Mills' driving layup brought the Spurs within three points with less than five minutes to play, and he also helped set up big quarters from Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green to key the comeback victory. Those who took a chance on Mills as a punt-play DFS option on the Wednesday were handsomely rewarded, but it's expected that Parker will be available to play in the Spurs' first game out of the All-Star break Feb. 18 against the Clippers.

Parker also shot 50 percent or better for the third straight game, but he remains one of the more inconsistent starting point guards in the league for fantasy purposes due to his generally modest playing time and frequent deference to others on offense.

Look for LaMarcus Aldridge, David West and Boris Diaw to start out handling most of the frontcourt minutes, with Boban Marjanovic getting some run if things get out of hand, which seems likely. Bonner's next chance to return will be Tuesday in Miami.

Aldridge has been outstanding during Tim Duncan's multi-game absence, and has been given the opportunity to put up numbers that are reminscent of his glory days in a Portland uniform. He's gotten February off to a remarkable start, averaging 26.0 points, 6.7 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 3.3 blocks, and 1.0 steals over 31.0 minutes in three contests.

          The All-Star small forward did what he could to keep the Spurs close, but the Cavs had too much firepower to overcome. Leonard continues to play at an elite level across the board, and his occasional scoring fluctations usually coincide with a minutes reduction due to the Spurs being on the winning end of a blowout. With San Antonio now having suffered two embarassing losses to quality opponents in the last three games to the Warriors and Cavs, Leonard and the rest of the starting unit could be in for some extended run in the forseeable future as coach Gregg Popovich attempts to get his team back on track.

This was particularly true on the glass, one of the areas in which the veteran power forward has made his mark. His two boards were the lowest he's amassed all season, and it was also his first game without an assist since Jan. 2 versus the Rockets. Aldridge did turn in his best month to date in a Spurs uniform in January however, posting a season-high average of 16.1 points, while also adding 8.6 boards and 1.7 assists per contest over 29.3 minutes.

Initially, it appeared the Spurs may have been up to their old tricks in holding Duncan out of a big game, but coach Gregg Popovich has since insisted that the 39-year-old is dealing with legitimate soreness in his knee. Duncan sitting out a third straight game would seem to back up that claim, and the Spurs will likely go with either Kyle Anderson or David West in his place Saturday.

          Duncan sat out of Thursday's win over the Suns in order to rest but was back out on the court Friday night to help the Spurs defeat the Lakers. The injury is likely a result of wear and tear on the 39-year-old during the season. The Spurs will opt to rest their star center in order to prevent any further injuries from manifesting. Look for Boris Diaw and Boban Marjanovic to see increased action on Monday as a result.

          The All-Star small forward once again was able to play a slightly less allotment of minutes than usual in what eventually was another comfortable victory against an overmatched opponent. While he put up his typically solid offensive numbers, Leonard was particularly proficient on the defensive end as well, setting a new high for the month in blocks and recording a pair of thefts for the fifth time in January. Due to the fact that the Spurs have been involved in several blowout wins, Leonard is averaging a modest 17.8 points per game this month, but is doing so over only 30.9 minutes per game.

          It was what amounts to a breakout game for Green these days, who is averaging his lowest amount of points per game (6.9) since his first season in a Spurs uniform back in the 2010-11 campaign. The 12 points were the first time Green has tallied double-digit scoring since January 2 versus Houston, and his four three-pointers equaled his second-highest total in that category on the season. His defensive effort was typically stellar, making it one of his most complete all-around performances of the season. Despite the notable outing however, Green's minutes continue to be limited, and the Spurs' system appears currently designed to have him focus on limiting his opponent first and concerning himself with scoring as a rather distant second.

          The veteran point guard was highly efficient and aggressive during his modest time on the court, turning in one of his better all-around shooting nights of the season. His scoring total was his best since hanging 22 on this same Lakers squad back on Dec. 11, and he took double-digit shot attempts for the second straight game and only the third time in January. Mills' contributions in the rebound category were also a pleasant surprise that served to round out his stat line nicely. The seven-year veteran's minutes have been consistently in the mid-teens at a minimum, and occasionally spike into the low-to-mid 20s, always making Mills a near-minimum priced option in daily formats and a source of three-point shooting in very deep season-long leagues.

Now, the team has announced that Aldridge is dealing with back spasms and will not take the floor Friday against the Lakers. Although Aldridge will sit out Friday, Tony Parker (hip) and Tim Duncan (rest) are expected to return to action against Los Angeles, which should limit the impact of Aldridge's absence.

          Like some of his other fellow reserves, the rookie received some extended run in the blowout win. Simmons has largely been productive all season when receiving even limited minutes, with his proficient shooting allowing him to amass point totals that have been impressive relative to his playing time. He now has four double-digit scoring performances over the last five contests in which he's received over 10 minutes on the floor, and is shooting an outstanding 65.9 percent from the field in January. Despite the productive outings, Simmons' playing time is too inconsistent to render him anything more than an occasional punt play in daily formats when the Spurs project for an easy victory.

          The veteran point guard followed up a season-high 31-point outing against the Pistons with a dynamic encore that was reminiscent of Parker's heyday. The 33-year-old appeared to be all over the court, draining buckets from the perimeter when necessary and slashing aggressively towards the basket when those opportunities opened up. His shot volume was elevated for a second straight game and third time in the last four contests as well, with his shot attempts during that span (16, 19 and 18, respectively) representing his three highest totals in that category this season.

          McCallum has logged only nine total minutes in the Spurs' last 11 games, but he could have a chance to take on a larger role Monday with Tony Parker (hip) out of the lineup. Given Gregg Popovich's track record, it's difficult to predict who will start in Parker's place, but whether it's McCallum or Patty Mills, both players figure to see increased run.

          Parker is dealing with some overall soreness to his right hip, but it's not expected to cost him a significant amount of time. With Parker sidelined, Patty Mills and Manu Ginobili could see extended minutes in the backcourt. We'll have to wait and see who coach Gregg Popovich decides to start in Parker's place. It seems likely that Parker will return for Wednesday's outing versus the Jazz.

          With Parker's shot not falling, the point guard instead turned his attention to setting up his mates, resulting in 20-plus-point nights for Boris Diaw, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Kawhi Leonard. Parker has had a few poor shooting performances sprinkled over his last five games, but he's still running at a 53.1 field-goal percentage for the season, an excellent mark for any player, much less a point guard.

          Diaw has been holding down a second-unit role throughout the season, but the 33-year-old has emerged as one of the team's top sources of offense over the last two weeks. He's reached double figures in the scoring column in five of the last seven games, averaging 11.9 points while shooting an impressive 63.2 percent from the field in that span.

The big man seems to be settling in after he experienced some issues getting acclimated earlier this season, but the Spurs' preference not to regularly hand him 35 minutes per game will make it virtually impossible for Aldridge to replicate the numbers he posted in 2014-15.

          Leonard rarely posts explosive scoring nights, but his consistency is something to be admired, as he's fallen between 17 and 27 points in each of his last 11 games. Moreover, few players are capable of matching Leonard's contributions in the blocks and steals categories, making him one of the most well-rounded fantasy assets out there.

          The six three-pointers were a season high for Green, who hasn't been living up to his reputation as a sharpshooter for much of the campaign. He only made six treys in the previous six games combined, and is sitting on a 30.1 percent mark from downtown on the season.

          Duncan, who had missed the Spurs' previous three games -- one for rest purposes and the other due to a sore right knee -- wasn't particularly aggressive on the offensive end, which was just fine for San Antonio while the shots were falling for Kawhi Leonard, LaMarcus Aldridge, and David West.

He only saw 30 minutes Saturday with the Spurs winning the game in a runaway fashion, which has become a common trend in December.

          Duncan has now posted just eight, five, four, and five points over the last four games, and he's clearly being rested on nights that don't require him to play a lot to win. The Spurs have been blowing out teams pretty frequently over the past few weeks, so this is expected. Although he has the capability to put up solid rebounding and block numbers, he probably won't see too many minutes down the stretch in an effort to rest for the playoffs, so he's not the best fantasy option at this point.

          Green, who has been in the midst of a season-long shooting slump that resulted in his being benched for much of the second half of Friday's win over the Lakers, was able to bounce back a bit Saturday. Still, the swingman is shooting just 33.2 percent from the field and 30.4 percent from three-point range over 25 games, so he'll need to turn things around quickly if he hopes to hold off rookie Jonathon Simmons for a starting role.

          The Spurs had Atlanta's number defensively in this one, holding the Hawks to just 25 points in the first half, the lowest output for any team in a half this season. Leonard needed a couple of games to completely shake off his bout of the flu, scoring just 23 points in his previous two contests combined, but it looks like he's back in top form.

          Coach Gregg Popovich is being very stingy with the 38-year-old's minutes this season, but Ginobili is still providing some instant offense when Pop does call his number. Unfortunately, his inconsistent usage pattern makes him far too risky in DFS, and his value in season-long leagues is restricted to only the deepest of formats.

          It was the second breakout performance for the veteran forward over the last three games, with Aldridge having tallied a season-high 26 points this past Monday versus the Sixers. As he had in that contest, Aldridge drained 11 buckets, equaling his season-high. It was also the 30-year-old's eighth double-double of the season, a feat he accomplished in very efficient fashion considering he only played 27 minutes.

          Leonard joined teammate LaMarcus Aldridge in posting a double-double, and also bounced back nicely from a pair of sub-par shooting performances. The All-Star small forward had shot just 33 percent (7-for-21) from the field over his last two games while dealing with an illness, but responded with his 13th performance of at least 50 percent accuracy in the 2015-16 campaign. The 11 rebounds also represented Leonard's second-best total of the season in that category, and he appears to be back at full health.

          The veteran guard was highly efficient in the blowout, tallying a point per minute on the floor. While the performance was certainly remarkable, Mills posts single-digit scoring nights more often than not, and Friday was simply a case of the 27-year-old catching fire from the field while equaling his second-highest number of shot attempts on the season. The sharpshooter also equaled a season-best from long range with a trio of three-pointers, and managed his second-best percentage (75 percent) from beyond the arc in a game in the 2015-16 campaign.
