          With LeBron James struggling on offense, Irving and Kevin Love picked up the slack. It was a particularly nice showing for Irving considering he left Sunday's game in the second quarter after feeling under the weather. A tough night in Chicago aside, Irving has been torching teams lately. He's scored 30 or more points in three of his last five while shooting over 50 percent from the field. Irving is still incredibly under-priced in DFS making him a pretty appealing cash-game play.

          Love didn't seem to lose much steam having to play on back-to-back nights, though he failed to record a double-double for the third straight game. The Cavs third wheel continues to struggle from distance, shooting 32.1 percent from 3-point range in his last five contests.

          King James had an unorthodox team-high six turnovers and scored just six points after the first quarter.

These types of games don't come very often, so expect James to bounce back in a big way Wednesday against the Hornets.

          There had been a bit of a holdup in getting Frye medically cleared, but he's passed all tests and will join his new team for the first time Monday night. Frye was unavailable Thursday against the Bulls, as well as Sunday against the Thunder. It's unlikely the veteran steps into a significant role right away, but the expectation is that he'll eventually occupy a rotation spot as a three-point shooting power forward off the bench, giving interim coach Tyronn Lue more flexibility when Kevin Love rests.

          Frye, who was acquired by the Cavaliers last Thursday in a three-team deal, has yet to debut for his new team while he waits to pass his physical. At this time, the Cavaliers don't appear to be concerned that Frye won't pass the physical by Tuesday's deadline, but the team has simply been exercising caution after the big man previously missed the 2012-13 campaign with an enlarged heart.

          Kyrie Irving exited in the first half, but James and Kevin Love proved more than capable of carrying the load in what proved to be a relatively easy win for the Cavs. James has been excellent of late, with averages of 25 points, 10.3 assists and 8.3 rebounds over the last four games, and he appears to have come out of the All-Star break in good form.

Thompson appears to be running with the starting gig at the moment, and coach Ty Lue is unlikely to shake tings up anytime soon, as Cleveland has gone 10-2 since the change.

          Love assumed a larger role after Kyrie Irving exited because of an illness in the first half, and he responded with one of his best all-around games of the season. It was his first 20-10 game of the month and just his third since late December, although he failed to knock down a triple for the first time in 20 games.

          During Dellavedova's five-game absence prior to the All-Star break, coach Tyronn Lue had responded by giving starting point guard elevated minutes, and that trend continued Thursday even though Dellavedova was back in the picture. Dellavedova more or less claimed Mo Williams' spot in the rotation, as Williams didn't play while Irving saw 31 minutes of court time. Now that Irving seems to have his restrictions fully lifted since his return from a fractured kneecap in late December, it seems fairly safe to conclude that Dellavedova's season average of 26.1 minutes will only plunge in the final two months of the campaign.

          Thompson has seen much of his time at center this season, but moved over to power forward Saturday with the bigger Timofey Mozgov entering the starting five in place of the injured Kevin Love (quad). Though Love's absence created a void on offense, the trio of Kyrie Irving, LeBron James, and J.R. Smith combined for 76 of the Cavs' 99 points, leaving little opportunity for Thompson to increase his shot total. That didn't prevent Thompson from doing what he does best in attacking the glass on both the offensive and defensive end, and he'll continue to remain an excellent source of rebounds even once Love is back on the court.

          Mozgov entered the starting lineup Saturday in place of the injured Kevin Love (quad), and though he received an uptick in court time from his season average, the center still provided little in the way of helpful production. Some early mistakes resulted in Mozgov ceding more court time than anticipated to Anderson Varejao, but Mozgov still figures to remain in a starting role for the duration of Love's absence. Coach Tyronn Lue said after Saturday's game that the Cavaliers are evaluating Love on a game-to-game basis, which likely means that a long-term absence isn't on tap for him.

          The absence of Kevin Love (quad) allowed Varejao to enter the frontcourt rotation, and he probably benefited from more playing time than anticipated after Timofey Mozgov made a number of poor offensive plays at the beginning of the game. Varejao didn't exactly set the court ablaze with his offensive skills, but he gave the Cavs good energy and forced Pelicans star Anthony Davis to earn his buckets. However, as long as Love's injury doesn't prove to be a long-term situation, Varejao can't count on regularly seeing more than 20 minutes in a game.

          The veteran point guard got in on the act in the Cavs' signature victory, bouncing back from two single-digit scoring performances against the Suns and Pistons. Dellavedova continues to provide an occasional offensive spark off the bench, and has the ability to eat up significant minutes during blowouts or when Kyrie Irving's playing time is being monitored. He's too inconsistent to trust in most formats, but can offer some value as an occasional near-minimum option in daily leagues.

          Like many of his teammates, Love has stepped up his level of play since the coaching change to Tyronn Lue. He now has three straight 20-point-plus performances, three consecutive games with multiple three-pointers and two double-doubles in the last three contests. He's also been a force on the glass, averaging 9.3 rebounds over that span. Although he averaged a modest 14.4 points per game in January, Love may be primed for a considerable uptick in production going forward under the more aggressive offensive style Lue has instituted.

          The All-Star point guard has apparently taken coach Tyronn Lue's directive to attack the basket to heart, posting back-to-back 20-point-plus outings for only the second time since his Dec. 20 return. After only posting 50 percent or better shooting from the field in four of his previous 14 games, Irving has now accomplished the feat in his last two contests as well. If he can maintain his current level of aggressiveness over an extended stretch, a return to last season's averages of 21.7 points, 3.2 rebounds and 5.7 assists is certainly within reach for the talented 23-year-old.

          The perennial All-Star spearheaded a signature win for the Cavs, who are playing at a much faster and aggressive pace under new coach Tyronn Lue. James exemplified this style with his play Saturday, attacking the basket and making his highest number of visits to the charity stripe since Dec. 4 versus the Pelicans. He also notably got the better of the Spurs' first-team defense for a change, and was outstanding on the defensive end with two blocks and two steals. James and the Cavs appear rejuvenated under Lue, and will be a force to reckon with if they can keep up their current level of play.

          Coming off Wednesday's 4-of-11 performance against the Suns, Irving looked much better offensively on Friday.

After a pair of low-scoring performances against the Warriors and Nets, Irving rebounded to score at least 20 points for the fifth time in January. Having played just 15 games this season, Irving still has time to match his previous statistical thresholds.

          Irving made only three of his 15 attempts from the field on Sunday versus the 76ers, but played well on Tuesday. Not only did he hand out nine helpers, Irving hit the dagger three-pointer to put the Cavaliers up by five with less than 20 seconds remaining in overtime.

He has a big test ahead on Thursday against reigning Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard and the Spurs, but the return of Kyrie Irving is clearly helping lessen the King's burden offensively.

          Love was considered questionable to play with an illness and he apparently made the last-second decision to give it a go right before tipoff. Unless his illness creeps up during the game, Love likely intends to play around his average of 32 minutes against the Raptors.

          He's now pulled down double-digit boards in six of his last eight games, although Thompson's limited offensive game has allowed him to record just three double-doubles over that stretch.

He's averaging just 13.8 points, 11.2 boards, 2.6 assists and 1.4 threes in the five games since Irving returned from his fractured kneecap, although Love also suffered a minor hand injury at about the same time. The near 20-and-10 he was putting up through the end of November likely isn't coming back, so don't be afraid to deal Love if you can get a good return.

          Thompson has started the Cavs' last two games at center, and according to David Blatt, it sounds like the 24-year-old will continue to top the depth chart ahead of Timofey Mozgov in the subsequent games to come. While Thompson hasn't noticed much of a bump in production and actually failed to corral double-digit rebounds Tuesday for the first time in five games, he'll still likely get a modest bump in overall fantasy value now that the gap in minutes between him and former starter Timofey Mozgov is likely to widen.

          It was widely expected that Dellavedova would see a steep drop in playing time upon Kyrie Irving's return from a knee injury last weekend, but that hasn't been the case as of yet. Dellavedova has received exactly 31 minutes in the last two contests, which actually exceeds his season average of 28.6.

          Dellavedova came off the bench on Sunday with Kyrie Irving (knee) making the start in his season debut. Irving played only 17 minutes in the Cavaliers' blowout win. Meanwhile, Mo Williams sat out his second straight game with a sprained thumb. It's unclear how soon Williams will be available to return, but if he does miss a few more games, Dellavedova could retain some decent value in the short-term.

      	<strong><a href="/player/#!/202697" class="ng-binding">Shumpert (groin) scored three points (1-5 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-2 FT), dished four assists, grabbed two rebounds, and recorded two takeaways in 16 minutes during the Cavaliers' 108-86 win versus the 76ers on Sunday.</a></strong><br><br>
          Shumpert missed Thursday's game versus the Thunder with a groin injury, but he was able to return on Sunday to appear in his third game of the year. Cleveland has a lot of depth on the wing, and Shumpert's best skill has always been his solid on-ball defense, something that doesn't necessarily translate into fantasy friendly numbers. Still, it's possible in due time that he could re-claim the starting spot he held during the Cavaliers' finals run last season.

          Irving drew the start in his season debut, but saw only 17 minutes of action. The Cavaliers will bring him along slowly as he returns from his knee injury, and it may take some time before he is back to earning his regular load of 30-plus minutes per game.

          Expect Shumpert, who was a game-time call heading into Sunday, to face a minutes restriction minutes after missing Thursday's game against the Thunder due to the strained groin. For the first time all season, the Cavaliers will have last year's starting backcourt of Kyrie Irving (kneecap) and Shumpert on the floor, though both players could come off the bench as they look to shake off their respective injuries.

          Shumpert missed Thursday's game after suffering a right groin strain late in Tuesday's win over the Celtics. He missed the first month and a half of the season recovering from wrist surgery, only playing in two games so far. If he does play Sunday, it will most likely be in a limited role.

          Harris has often scuttled between Canton and Cleveland this season, appearing in 10 games for the former and five games for the latter. He's unlikely to see the court very often now that he's back with the Cavs.
