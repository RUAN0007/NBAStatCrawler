          Williams coughed up the rock four times and committed four fouls, but still managed to see one more minute than rookie starter D'Angelo Russell, who is set to start the remainder of the season ahead of Williams. Nevertheless, coach Byron Scott has shown time and again that he prefers to play veterans, and the fact that Williams is coming off the bench now doesn't mean he won't play more minutes than both Russell and Jordan Clarkson.

          There is no saying how much less Scott intends to play Kobe, but the goal is to get younger guys some more minutes. Before Bryant's recent scoring streak, during which he frequently played 30-plus minutes, his playing time was quite sporadic in the first place. Coach Scott's comment could mean a return to 15-25 minutes per game for Kobe, but the comment really isn't worth taking too seriously until the Lakers return to action and evidence of the comment is proven.

          Though Hibbert was on the court for shootaround, Scott was apparently unwilling to give the center clearance to play, so the Lakers will likely wait until closer to pregame warmups to reach a conclusion on the center's status. Even if he's not 100 percent healthy, Hibbert should do everything he can to make sure he's able to play in a matchup against his former team. If the Lakers do opt to play it safe and hold him out, however, the trio of Brandon Bass, Robert Sacre, and Tarik Black would be tasked with filling Hibbert's minutes.

          It looks like the shoulder is going to be an ongoing problem for Bryant for the remainder of the season, but the veteran is expected to play through any lingering soreness more often than not. Even so, it wouldn't be surprising if he was rested at some point in the near future, as he's now played in four consecutive games.

          The second-year pro put together an impressive performance in a marquee matchup, getting the best of veteran Tony Parker on several occasions and going over the 20-point mark for the first time since Jan. 14 versus the Warriors. Clarkson has been scorching from the field over the last four games as well, posting 50 percent or better accuracy in each contest and shooting 59 percent (30-for-51) overall during that stretch. The feat is particularly notable considering that the 23-year-old had only been able to equal or top the 50 percent mark seven times in the previous 31 games, dating back to Dec. 1.

          The second-year pro managed his fourth double-double in the last five games before departing, continuing a stretch of highly impressive play.

          Williams recently dealt with an upper respiratory infection, and missed last Thursday's match-up versus the Bulls. However, he has played in three straight contests now, and seems to be fully healthy once again. Williams managed to go 8-for-8 from the free-throw line on Sunday -- salvaging a 1-for-10 effort from the field to score 11 points -- and "Sweet Lou" has hit 24 freebies over the last three games. Even though there are several mouths to feed in L.A., the fact that Williams consistently earns north of 30 minutes helps dispel the doubts of skeptical fantasy owners.

Russell saw 30 or more minutes 10 times in November and December, and coach Byron Scott has kept the rookie point guards on a tight leash for the most part. Still, it's reasonable to expect more heavy minute allotments as the season progresses, and Tuesday's performance seemed to indicate Russell is ready.

It's best not to take these types of performances for granted, as the 37-year-old warrior's body continues to wear down, but if he stays healthy for the remainder of the year, it's crazy to count out a couple more 30-point showings from the Mamba.

In an effort to avoid worsening Nance's situation, the Lakers will give the rookie two weeks' worth of rest with the hope that it helps resolve the knee issue. The Lakers' first game after the All-Star break will be Feb. 19 against the Spurs, meaning that Nance is set to miss at least five games.

          The second-year pro was one of the highlights for the Lakers in the loss to their inter-city rivals, with Randle posting his fourth double-double in the last seven contests. His season-high scoring total coincided with Randle receiving his most abundant allotment of playing time on the season, and appeared to further cement the notion that he's usurped Larry Nance, Jr. for the starting power forward role for the long term. If Randle can continue building on his five consecutive double-digit scoring performances, he should receiving the playing time he needs to post a breakout second half of the season.

          The veteran shooting guard returned from a one-game absence due to an illness, but was notably less aggressive than he's been in any of his starting opportunities this season. The six shot attempts, likely an outlier, represented his lowest amount in any game Williams has started in the current campaign, and he needed 10 visits to the charity stripe to get into double-digit points. Williams may have stil been shaking off the bug that caused him to miss Thursday's contest versus the Bulls, and should be back to normal for the Lakers' next game on Sunday.

          Coach Byron Scott wants to ease Nance back into the lineup, so he'll bring him off the bench Tuesday and keep his minutes limited. Julius Randle is expected to remain in the starting lineup in his place and should receive the majority of the power forward minutes. As soon as Nance is back to full health, he's expected to return to the starting lineup.

          Bryant had his sore Achilles worked on by team physicians during halftime before ultimately being ruled out for the remainder of the contest. He finishes the night with five points on 2-of-8 shooting and his status for Sunday's game against the Rockets is in question.

Clarkson shot over 50 percent from the field for only the second time in January, after tallying a forgettable 29 percent success rate versus New Orleans. The 23-year-old is now averaging a robust 15.9 shot attempts in January, his most prolific monthly figure in that category by far this season. The elevated volume has led to a solid 17.5 scoring average over the Lakers' eight contests to date during the month, and rendered Clarkson and Louis Williams a highly potent backcourt duo.

          Bass missed Sunday's loss to the Jazz with a corneal abrasion in his right eye but it appears that he'll be ready to return to the court Tuesday night. He is likely to split minutes with Larry Nance and Julius Randle, who is also scheduled to return Tuesday night after missing time with a foot injury.

          Bass has a corneal abrasion as suffered in last Friday's loss to the Thunder. Though probable against the Pelicans on Tuesday, it is possible that Anthony Brown, Larry Nance, Ryan Kelly and Julius Randle will pick up extra minutes while Bass eases his way back.

          Russell suffered a sprained ankle in Thursday's win over the Kings. He was only able to play eight minutes in Friday's loss to Thunder and was ruled out of Sunday's loss to the Jazz. After resting the ankle the past couple of days, it appears that Russell will be able to return to the court on Tuesday. His decision to play likely hinges on how Tuesday's shootaround and pregame warmup goes. If he is held out, look for Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams to see more minutes.

          Bryant is dealing with both a sore right shoulder and a strained Achilles, despite playing in both of the Lakers last two contests. It is likely that Anthony Brown will fill any minutes missed by Kobe should he choose to sit. However, it is also likely that Mamba will play if he really wants to being it his last season.
